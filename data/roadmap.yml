  blurb: 'After discussion with developers, post-quantum cryptographers and research into existing roadmap of blockchain technology, the QRL whitepaper was written to provide an overview of quantum resistant methodologies. The Winternitz OTS+ and Extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) were identified as the optimal solutions. This investigation also revealed the necessity of QRL to stand alone as a network with interoperability in the later pipeline.'

  blurb: "The introduction and solidification of variable key heights and signature space allows us to ensure future compatibility with almost anything. Our blockchain now includes the possibility to upgrade signature schemes (XMSS, SPHINCS, + future) and through an address format update, support different cryptographic hash functions (SHA2_256, SHAKE_128, SHAKE256 etc)."
