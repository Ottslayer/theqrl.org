blurb: "The Sandwich framework allows developers to build their own protocols and
  implementations that can be changed and reconfigured in response to new threats
  and technologies without rewriting code. The solution, currently used by several
  US government agencies, global banks, telcos, and tech companies, can be embedded
  into internal applications and commercial software and supports multiple languages,
  operating systems, and cryptographic libraries. \n\nFuture plans for the solution
  include the ability to create smaller and larger “sandwiches” to access basic or
  broad functionality, as well as multi-layered “sandwiches” with an array of functions,
  such as enabling access to cryptography at different abstraction levels.\n"
