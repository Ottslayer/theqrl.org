blurb: |
  Quantum Machines has launched its new advanced quantum control solution, OPX1000, which offers industry-leading performance metrics including feedback capabilities, runtime, analog performance, and channel density. The modular quantum controller is designed to scale control of quantum computers to 1000 qubits and beyond. The solution is currently being deployed with select customers and will be generally available later this year. OPX1000 is programmed using Quantum Machines' intuitive pulse-level language, QUA, or at the gate level using the OpenQASM3 to QUA compiler extension. The company aims to push the entire field of quantum computing forward and accelerate the realization of useful quantum computers.
