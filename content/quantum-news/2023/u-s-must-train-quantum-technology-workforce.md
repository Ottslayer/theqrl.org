blurb: |
  The United States currently lacks the talent required to maintain competitiveness in this field, posing a national security risk. The race to commercialize and deploy quantum systems has become a battleground of U.S.-China competition, with other countries like Australia, Japan, Canada, and the UK also making progress. The United States faces a shortage of quantum talent and a general STEM skills gap. To fill these gaps, international collaboration, initiatives to retain foreign-born workers, and reskilling programs are necessary.
