## What is Vinex?

Vinex is a digital assets exchange based in Singapore. It is self-described as, “One of the 3 pillars of Midas Ecosystem: Wallet — Exchange — Fund.” [The blog goes on to say](https://support.vinex.network/hc/en-us/articles/360022383431-Overview-of-Vinex-Network-Crypto-Exchange) that Vinex is a member of the Singapore Fintech Association, and the Digital Exchanges Association of Singapore. You can read more about it in [their own words](https://support.vinex.network/hc/en-us/articles/360022383431-Overview-of-Vinex-Network-Crypto-Exchange).

As you can see from their own [blog post](https://support.vinex.network/hc/en-us/articles/360034567931-Quantum-Resistant-Ledger-QRL-is-now-listed-on-Vinex) earlier today, QRL will be available to be traded on the [QRL/BTC](https://vinex.network/market/BTC_QRL) and [QRL/USDT](https://vinex.network/market/USDT_QRL) pairs. Currently, both the [QRL/BTC](https://vinex.network/market/BTC_QRL) and [QRL/USDT](https://vinex.network/market/USDT_QRL) pairs are live — you can check it out [here](https://vinex.network/market/BTC_QRL).
