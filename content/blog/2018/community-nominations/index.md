Our community contains an amazing assortment of people that have a wide range of professions and origins. *Many* of those people continually go above and beyond in improving QRL and furthering Quantum Computing Awareness in the blockchain space.

It’s time we recognised these people who go above and beyond, which we will do with *nominations.*

**Nominations *are a* way for the *community* to point out *other* community members on a weekly basis who contribute positively to QRL or Quantum Computing in general. Of these people that the community points out, one will be selected to be *nominated* to receive 250 Quanta.**

## How it works

One requirement is that nominations are made through Discord, so if you’re not already signed up, do so [here](/discord).

Anyone can* *nominate a wide variety of people active in different platforms like Reddit, Medium, Twitter, and Discord (more added as necessary). These people don’t *have* to be active in our community either, as we will reach out.

The nominations are gathered *weekly *and settled at Monday’s meeting, with an award of 250 Quanta (at the mercy of scheduling and other such conflicts of course). We do take into heavy consideration how many *votes* a person has, *however*, also reserve the final say (to prevent novelty votes from reigning supreme — this is the internet after all).

Once a person has been nominated, contacted, *and* awarded, they are exempt from winning a nomination for 8 weeks.

On a final note, these are for *people*, not Companies and/or Organisations.

### Nominating (how it works, technically)

Nominating is easy, in the *butler* channel on discord you can add:

```
nominate add [reddit/discord/twitter/medium/github] username
```


or remove (only your own nomination, of course):

```
nominate remove [reddit/discord/twitter/medium/github] username
```


If you want to see the *current* nominations:

```
nominate list
```


To see nominations from previous weeks (but not necessarily the winners), you’ll need to specify the week # (‘w’ is optional):

```
nominate list W15
```


## What we’re looking for

Want to be in line for a nomination? Bringing awareness/contributions to QRL or Quantum Computing in general is a good mindset to start from.

This can include:

* Code Contributions
* User Art
* GitHub Issues
* Positive social contribution online

## When is this starting?

We’ll be opening up nominations on Tuesday, November 6th, 2018 and having our first settlement, assuming an appropriate nominee is found, on Monday, November 12th, 2018.
