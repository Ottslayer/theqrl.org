blurb: "The DARPA program ONISQ has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing by
  creating the world's first quantum circuit with logical quantum bits (qubits). \n\nQuantum
  computing has the potential to revolutionize various fields by exploiting quantum
  effects and complex mathematics to significantly speed up information processing.
  However, the high error rate in quantum computing has been a challenge. DARPA's
  approach involves using Rydberg qubits, which have the advantage of being homogeneous,
  allowing for rapid scaling and easy manipulation using lasers. This enables dynamic
  reconfiguration and transportability of logical qubits on a quantum chip, overcoming
  previous error-prone methods. DARPA has connected 48 logical qubits so far, paving
  the way for scalable quantum computing processors with less complexity than originally
  anticipated. \n"
