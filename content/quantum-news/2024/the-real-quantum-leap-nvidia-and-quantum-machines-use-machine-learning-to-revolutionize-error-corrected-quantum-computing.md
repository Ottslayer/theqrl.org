Nvidia and Quantum Machines are collaborating to advance quantum computing by focusing on error correction, a critical component for realizing the technology's full potential. They are utilizing Nvidia's DGX Quantum platform to improve qubit calibration, which is essential for maintaining high fidelity in quantum operations. By applying reinforcement learning algorithms, they have optimized qubit control on a Rigetti quantum chip, particularly through continuous recalibration of Ï€ pulses. 

This innovative method not only enhances immediate results but also lays the groundwork for effective quantum error correction, addressing performance drift in quantum computers.
