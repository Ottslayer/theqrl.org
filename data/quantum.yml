    Researchers, led by Jeff Thompson at Princeton University, have developed a novel method to detect and correct errors in quantum computers in real time, potentially making them up to ten times easier to correct. 
    
    This advancement, detailed in a [recent paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06438-1), focuses on identifying errors more easily than previous methods, which primarily aimed to reduce error probabilities. By utilizing a different set of energy levels within atoms to store qubits, the team can monitor qubits during computations and detect errors without destroying the qubits.

  date: 2023-12-19
  blurb: |
    Ryan Babbush and his colleagues at Google have developed an algorithm to translate a large range of classical problems so that they can be run on quantum computers. “There's an important class of classical systems in which we can get an exponential speed-up in simulating the dynamics of those systems on a quantum computer,” says Babbush.

    Babbush and his team realised that the mathematics of these classical spring systems, however complex, could always be expressed as a version of the Schrödinger equation, which describes how any quantum system changes through time.

    Babbush and his team haven't calculated how many qubits would be needed to run their algorithm, but it is likely to be beyond today's machines. However, it could be one of the first applications that a “relatively modest” error-corrected quantum computer is used for, says Babbush.

    The DARPA program ONISQ has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing by creating the world's first quantum circuit with logical quantum bits (qubits). 
    
    Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize various fields by exploiting quantum effects and complex mathematics to significantly speed up information processing. However, the high error rate in quantum computing has been a challenge. DARPA's approach involves using Rydberg qubits, which have the advantage of being homogeneous, allowing for rapid scaling and easy manipulation using lasers. This enables dynamic reconfiguration and transportability of logical qubits on a quantum chip, overcoming previous error-prone methods. DARPA has connected 48 logical qubits so far, paving the way for scalable quantum computing processors with less complexity than originally anticipated.

    Researchers at QuTech, a collaboration between the Delft University of Technology and TNO, have developed a new method for addressing quantum dots that could enable the operation of larger gate-defined quantum dot systems. The method uses a chessboard-like approach, where quantum dots are addressed using a combination of horizontal and vertical lines, similar to how chess pieces are addressed with letters and numbers. This approach reduces the number of control lines needed to address multiple qubits, potentially enabling the scaling up of quantum systems. The researchers also highlight the importance of improving the quality of qubits, with recent demonstrations showing a 99.992% fidelity. Additionally, the researchers discuss the potential application of quantum dot systems for quantum simulation, as they have shown that an array of germanium quantum dots can be used for rudimentary simulations of resonating valence bonds. The researchers are now focused on scaling up the chessboard circuits and exploring the possibility of interconnecting them to build even larger quantum circuits.

  date: 2023-08-12
  blurb: |
    Google is deploying a hybrid key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) in its Chrome browser to protect the sharing of encryption secrets during the establishment of secure network connections. The new system, called X25519Kyber768, combines the X25519 elliptic curve algorithm and Kyber-768, a quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm. The move is in anticipation of future quantum computers that could potentially break existing encryption schemes. Google's early deployment of the technology is also practical for network administrators as it adds extra data to TLS ClientHello messages to strengthen security. The deployment of post-quantum encryption is seen as a necessary step in protecting valuable data shared over networks today and in the future.

    Researchers have made significant progress in improving the accuracy of a technology used to control quantum bits (qubits), which is essential for scaling up quantum computers. The technology uses flux quanta, units of magnetic flux, to control superconducting qubits. By physically separating the qubits from the control circuits, researchers achieved an accuracy above 99%. This development could provide a more scalable and practical pathway to quantum computation. Further refinements could potentially increase the accuracy even more. The improvement addresses a major obstacle in the development of large-scale quantum computers, which requires accurate results in the presence of environmental noise.

  blurb: | 
    A quantum computer has run the largest quantum program yet. The computer made errors, but a mathematical method was able to extract a meaningful result anyway. This error-mitigation technique could help quantum computers become more useful than their imperfect hardware would otherwise allow them to be. IBM's quantum computer had qubits made from tiny wires that conduct electricity perfectly. Superconducting qubits are typically programmed by being hit with pulses of microwaves, so running the new program was equivalent to programming a microwave pulse sequence.

    Previously, the team's largest meaningful quantum circuit used 26 qubits and contained 1080 individual operations. Now, the researchers have run a quantum circuit with 127 qubits and over 1700 individual operations.

  blurb: | 
    Quantum computing company Quantinuum made three more announcements at IEEE Quantum Week 2022. Announcements include another quantum volume record, a new method to make two-qubit gates with higher fidelity and greater efficiency, and a milestone achievement of more than a half-million downloads of its software.

    1. **Highlight 1: Shuttling ion pairs through intersections and negotiating 90 degree turns:** It may not sound significant, but this research provides the capability to execute Quantinuum’s long term roadmap for future generations of H-series quantum computers. Ion trap researchers have been working on this problem for years. Prior to Quantinuum’s research, it was believed that the only way for paired ions to move through zones was to first separate the pair, then move them through junctions one at a time. That solution would have significantly increased processing time.
    2. **Highlight 2: Closing the gap on fault-tolerant quantum error correction:** Fault tolerant quantum error correction will make it possible to build quantum computers with enough qubits to solve problems far beyond the reach of today's supercomputers. Quantinuum researchers were able to construct a logical entangling circuit that had a higher fidelity than its physical counterpart.
    
    17 other significant improvements over the last 12 months are:

    In 2013, Rigetti Computing began its push to make quantum computers. That effort could bear serious fruit starting in 2023, the company said Friday.

    That's because next year, the Berkeley, California-based company plans to deliver both its fourth-generation machine, called Ankaa, and an expanded model called Lyra. The company hopes those machines will usher in "quantum advantage," when the radically different machines mature into devices that actually deliver results out of the reach of conventional computers, said Rigetti founder and Chief Executive Chad Rigetti.

    “We believed we had cracked the code for building a million-qubit quantum computer,” Dr. Shadbolt said. “Even though that's a huge number, the secret seemed simple. All we had to do was use the same process as the one being used to put billions of transistors into cell phones. We felt a large quantum computer wouldn’t exist in our lifetime unless we figured out how to build it in a semiconductor foundry. That idea has been turned into reality. We are now building quantum chips next to laptops and cell phone chips on the GlobalFoundries 300-millimeter platform.”
