## A bit of a backstory

In **2016, 4 years ago**, after discussions with developers, post-quantum cryptographers and predictive? research into existing roadmap of blockchain technology, the [QRL whitepaper](https://github.com/theQRL/Whitepaper/blob/master/QRL_whitepaper.pdf) was authored and first QRL node was brought online. A core technical team with members that includes core blockchain developer [Kaushal Kumar Singh](/team/kaushal), PhD post-quantum cryptographer [Leon Groot Bruinderink](/team/leon/), and full-stack developer [JP Lomas](/team/jp) was assembled.

Fast forward to **June 2018, 2 years ago**, when mainnet (actinium) was released as the first (and still only) [post-quantum secure blockchain](https://qrl.foundation/assets/QRLF-PR-20180626.pdf) using XMSS, a signature algorithm that would be later be approved by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST). This foresight and focus on unparalleled security would later cement QRL as a blockchain for visionaries, academics, and enterprises alike.

The mainnet (actinium) release was complete with a full suite of functionality that forms the bedrock for additional features down the road.

- 100% post-quantum secure address space
- GUI wallets for Mac, Windows, and Linux
- Quantum Resistant Tokens (QRT’s)
- Quantum Resistant Notarisation
- Extensible address format

Then we have **Bromine**, released in 2020, which added:

- Quantum Secure Multi-signature addresses & transactions
- Ephemeral Messaging LatticeTX - Project Mercury
- Upgrade consensus protocol to RandomX

Future forks such as **Cesium** and **Dysprosium** will include:

- Full Ephemeral Messaging System functionality
- Proof-of-Stake
- Smart Contracts

None of this would be possible without the support and [contributors from our community](/#contributors).

## The updated website

With a growing number of features and users, we considered multiple user persona's with proper Call-to-Action items along the way. There were also a few community feature requests that we've integrated - and some that weren't yet, but will be.

### The roadmap is back

The roadmap page is the best page to see where we've been, where we are, and where we're going.

### A team page, with profiles

Transparency and communication in our industry is key. The team page gives you a visual of the team that’s behind the QRL.

### Blogs are now integrated

The new blog will keep you informed regarding what the teams are currently working on. Our blog posts have been moved back over to the new website, allowing for a better user experience for the QRL community moving forward.

### Press kit

For media/press outlets, our new Press Kit page is an easy place to quickly grab QRL brand assets.

### New website = New QRL newsletter

With the launch of the new website, we're bringing back our QRL email newsletter. To abide by GDPR regulations, we need those of you that subscribed to our previous newsletter to re-optin so we can have consent. If you haven't done so already, be sure to subscribe below to stay informed on the latest QRL news.
