Jack Matier brings with him a multi-faceted background working as everything from an equestrian farm hand to handling server farms. 

With his bread and butter being IT since 2003, he's cut his position out as a Linux Systems Administrator for organizations that want to setup their own bespoke website hosting infrastructure for a limited number of (often internal) clients.
