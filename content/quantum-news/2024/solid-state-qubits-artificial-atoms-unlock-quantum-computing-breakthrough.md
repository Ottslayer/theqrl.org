blurb: |
  JILA breakthrough in integrating artificial atoms with photonic circuits advances quantum computing efficiency and scalability.

  Historically, there have been problems with integrating artificial atoms with photonic circuits. This is because creating the artificial atoms (where atoms are knocked out of a diamond crystal) is a very random process, leading to random placement of the artificial atoms, random number of artificial atoms at each location, and random color each artificial atom emits.

  In a new Nano Letters paper, Sun, his research team, and collaborators from Stanford University proposed a new method that would pave the way to solving these two challenges, enabling a more complicated integrated quantum photonic circuit.
