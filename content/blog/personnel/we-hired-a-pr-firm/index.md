QRL is excited to announce that we have hired TransformPR as our PR firm of choice to help us through our next stage as we continue to grow as a project. TransformPR has been in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space since 2013 and currently its clients represent about 31% of the total cryptocurrency marketcap. The documents were signed last week, and we are happy to say that work is already underway, and a number of exciting placements are coming up in the next few weeks.

With offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Cape Town, and a global headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Transform is perfectly situated to help QRL expand globally and maximize the impact of our message.

TransformPR has represented more than 200 companies, organizations and projects in the blockchain space, and has helped more than 80 token crowdsales and scaling campaigns, including Aeternity, Augur, Bancor, Bittrex, Counterparty, Dash, Ethereum, Factom, Golem Network, Gnosis, Kraken, Lisk, Rivetz, SALT Lending, ShapeShift, Storj, Syscoin, and WAX.

Transform is led by Michael Terpin, Founder and CEO, who has more than 25 years of PR agency management. Michael directly supervised many PR campaigns of the digital media era, including early-stage PR for America Online, Earthlink, Jupiter, Motley Fool, Match.com, and Shapeways, as well as full-service campaigns for AT&T, Fujitsu, JBL, Konami, Marriott, Memorex, Philips, Rackspace, and TEAC.

We are excited for how Transform will help us reach out into more non-endemic outlets and spaces, as well as help us cut through the noise inside the ever-more-crowded blockchain/cryptocurrency space.

On a personal note, I am overjoyed to have them on board as it will allow me to focus more on *creating* content and determining forward-looking strategy, and less time chasing after reporters and outlets trying to *place* said content. Transform has already lined up a number of placements and interviews, some of the traditional sort, and some of a more colloquial variety (podcast, etc).

Everyone should look forward to seeing those placements come to light in the next few weeks, and going forward expect a stronger press presence for QRL in all of its endeavors.

TransformPR — welcome to the team!
