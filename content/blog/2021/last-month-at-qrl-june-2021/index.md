## Highlight

### Celebrating three years of QRL

{{< image "./images/highlight-anniversary.png" >}}

On **June 26th 2018**, after two years of meticulous development, QRL mainnet was launched. Since then, not only has [QRL](/blog/celebrating-three-years-of-qrl/#starting-from-block-0-genesis-to-today) come a long way, but so has the rest of the [quantum computing space](http://localhost:1313/blog/celebrating-three-years-of-qrl/#quantum-computing-highlights-over-three-years). 

The pace of progress with quantum computers has been so fast that quantum computing is on the precipice of moving out of its niche. We also believe QRL will follow as QRL moves towards mainstream adoption and looks towards expanding its already high-level tech talent pool development operations out of the UAE.

**To celebrate** our three year anniversary since mainnet (~5 years since the first commit), we've planned out multiple months of events.

For the end of June, we have held ten trivia questions and two puzzles per day. This upcoming month of July, we will be unveiling several different mascots whose styles will needed to be voted on. We expect the voting on each mascot to be open through from Sunday to Friday.

From the mascots that won, we'll have more created and a mascot meme contest will ensue! Finally later in August, we'll be holding a mascot merchandise contest!

More about the milestone and event can be found in our [Celebrating three years of QRL](/blog/celebrating-three-years-of-qrl/) blog.
  
## Development updates

### EnQlave

- Tooling to create importable compiled smart contracts of the UI 
- EnQlave mobile & desktop wallets are close to being done.
- Work on the EnQlave bridge

### Tokenomics repository from QRL contributors

The goal of the QRL Tokenomics repository is to provide tools and datasets for end users to evaluate different tokenomics of QRL. This includes `macrotokencomics` and `microtokenomics`, but primarily deals with the latter.

```bash
usage: emissions.py [-h] [-r REPORT] [-b BLOCK] [-y YEARS] [-c]

Simple QRL emission program

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -r REPORT   Report type: blocks, daily
  -b BLOCK    Block to get
  -y YEARS    How many years to output. Default 200
  -c          Report as cumulative
```

### From Scalpels to Qubits: The Story of the World's First Post Quantum Block Chain

> For more than a decade, Peter Waterland diligently pursued his role of a surgeon. At the same time, he began delving into a variety of intellectual activities (so much so that he gained a reputation as a polymath). Among these were cryptography, programming and blockchain technology, all of which propelled him to become a passionate cryptocurrency champion.

### Quantum Computing: The Cause of the Next Crypto Crash

> The notion that a quantum computer might someday break bitcoin is quickly gaining ground. That’s because quantum computers are becoming powerful enough to factor large prime numbers, a critical component of bitcoin’s public key cryptography.
