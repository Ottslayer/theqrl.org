## Background

In 2016, Peter Waterland put together the [QRL whitepaper](https://github.com/theQRL/Whitepaper/blob/master/QRL_whitepaper.pdf), [initial commits](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/commit/1f2de1cd469f0415ea6d9ff7a6dffe39d3f3ac62), and a core technical team with members that includes core developer Kaushal Kumar Singh, PhD post-quantum cryptographer Leon Groot Bruinderink, and full-stack developer JP Lomas.

Since then, not only has the core team grown, but so has the community, and together they launched the first post-quantum secure blockchain using a signature algorithm that’s draft approved by the [National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-208/draft).

The progress of quantum computing has grown too, from [google achieving quantum supremacy](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone) to [honeywell’s announcement that they *not only* doubled the quantum volume](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/03/behind-the-scenes-of-a-major-quantum-breakthrough) but that they *also* have [plans to increase that quantum volume by an order of magnitude each year](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/pressreleases/2020/03/honeywell-achieves-breakthrough-that-will-enable-the-worlds-most-powerful-quantum-computer) for the next five years.

## Upcoming AMA Details

While this AMA will be with QRL’s founder, Peter Waterland, at the heart of it, the QRL is a decentralised public cryptocurrency with an [open source](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/blob/master/LICENSE) codebase for anyone to contribute to. Just like in other projects there is no CEO of the QRL. The foundation will support the development roadmap until such time as this process may be governed on-chain, which is in progress.

### Details

Questions can be asked in several different ways up to July 3rd, 2020:

**For the *competition***

1. Post the most technical question that’s relevant to QRL* on twitter with the tag #qrlama along with a link to the blog post or twitter mention @qrledger
1. The person with the most technical question posted that’s relevant* to QRL will be selected to win 1000 QRL.
	
\* *Examples of relevant questions include our [current or upcoming features](/blog/last-month-at-qrl-may-2020#46a8), the [post-quantum cryptography we use](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391), or quantum computing and how it will impact blockchain.*

**Or ask in many other places**

1. The QRL Discord channel [#qrlama](/discord)
1. Wherever this announcement is *posted*

**From that**, we’ll compile the questions and do our best to record them in an audio format and put that in a video on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2PP3kR9APyRUa9kRH8-uA) which will be posted on July 20th, 2020.
