summary: "The recent study highlights a breakthrough in quantum photonics, demonstrating
  significant progress in integrating single-photon sources on-chip at room temperature,
  which is crucial for advancing quantum computing, cryptography, and sensing. \n\nBy
  employing a hybrid metal–dielectric bullseye antenna for exceptional photon directionality,
  the research showcases a method for efficient photon back-excitation and coupling,
  using either colloidal quantum dots or nanodiamonds as single-photon emitters. Achieving
  front collection efficiencies of about 70% with low numerical aperture optics, this
  innovation simplifies the integration of quantum light sources into practical quantum
  systems, promising to accelerate the development of quantum photonic devices. The
  research, led by Boaz Lubotzky and Prof. Ronen Rapaport, alongside international
  collaborators, represents a pivotal advancement in quantum technology applications,
