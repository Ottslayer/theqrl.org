We are delighted to announce that **[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com)** has successfully migrated the QRL ERC20s in their possession and that all QRL markets on Bittrex are now trading the mineable, main network Quanta (while still maintaining the $QRL ticker). Link to [QRL-BTC Bittrex market](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-QRL).

As we stated in our [announcement blog](/blog/bittrex-exchange-migration-proper-liquidity-secured-for-the-qrl), the entire QRL team would like to thank the team at Bittrex for working closely with us to ensure this smooth transition.

As a reminder The QRL is the first fully post-quantum blockchain ecosystem designed from the ground up with a core of:

* multiple implementations for qrl node (python, go)
* desktop GUI wallet (mac, windows, linux)
* a fantastic [web-wallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org/) with built in features such as document notarisation and full token support
* CLI Wallet
* our trusty web e[xplorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org/)
* growing [documentation](https://docs.theqrl.org)
* [API](https://api.theqrl.org) â€” we are easy to build into!

## Migration deadline

Reminder: We have set a deadline (contingent on Ledger release of version 1.5) for **28th February 2019 **for when we will close our automated migration [portal](http://migration.theqrl.org). If you would like to know how to migrate using the current system, we have a handy how-to video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxjMZGxm7A). For further help on this process you can always contact the team via [support@theqrl.org](http://support@theqrl.org) or discuss with the team on [Discord](/discord).
