## Highlights

We're pleased to announced that the **QRL Mainnet Version 3 (codenamed Cesium) hard fork has been successful!**

This mainnet release is the result of [QRL Improvement Proposal #16 (QIP-016)](/qips/qip016/) which proposed to reduce QRL emissions in order to improve the network. As part of the QIP process, many of the [positive and negative considerations](/blog/qip016-reduce-emission-rate-of-the-network-prevote-synopsis/) were discussed at length before being put to our first on-chain vote resulting in the QIPs approval. The final determination can be found on the [QIP GitHub discussion page](https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/32#issuecomment-975645693).

Specifically, this hard fork implements an emission reduction by a multiplication factor of **0.4x** of the per block coinbase reward starting at the hard fork block height of **1,938,000**, which had an estimated datetime of **2022-02-25 12:30 UTC** and successfully completed about 10 hours ahead of schedule at **2022-02-24 2:42 UTC**.

We would like to thank everyone who participated in the worlds first post-quantum secure on-chain vote to help put this hard fork into motion, and are happy to share in the journey as we take one step closer to truly decentralized governance.
