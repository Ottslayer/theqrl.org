blurb: "Quantum computing, just like traditional computing, needs a way to store the
  information it uses and processes. On the computer you're using right now, information,
  whether it be photos of your dog, a reminder about a friend's birthday, or the words
  you're typing into your browser's address bar, has to be stored somewhere. Quantum
  computing, being a new field, is still working out where and how to store quantum
  information.\n\nScientists at Caltech have developed a new method for storing quantum
  information using sound waves. By leveraging phonons, the sound equivalent of photons,
  they have created a small device capable of efficiently translating electrical quantum
  states into sound and vice versa, enabling the storage and retrieval of quantum
  information. \n"

Quantum computing, being a new field, is still working out where and how to store quantum information.

Scientists at Caltech have developed a new method for storing quantum information using sound waves. By leveraging phonons, the sound equivalent of photons, they have created a small device capable of efficiently translating electrical quantum states into sound and vice versa, enabling the storage and retrieval of quantum information.
