## Introduction

As we wrote in our most recent [blog](/blog/last-week-in-qrl-august-20-26), we at QRL are always looking for new opportunities to expand the reasonable coverage area for liquidity for our users. We are also looking to deepen that coverage where and how it can serve the greater good. We are happy to announce that both of those ends are properly pursued with the listing of QRL on the Cryptofacil trading platform.
