  blurb: | 
    Cornell researchers have recently taken a step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing: they constructed a simple model containing exotic particles called non-Abelian anyons, compact and practical enough to run on modern quantum hardware. Realizing these particles, which can only exist in two dimensions, is a move towards implementing it in the real world.

    Eun-Ah Kim, professor of physics (A&S), “With this 10-qubit system, we were able to encode multiple non-Abelian anyons, and therefore multiple logical information-carrying qubits, and a precise recipe for what the experimentalists need to do every step of the way.”

    A quantum computer has run the largest quantum program yet. The computer made errors, but a mathematical method was able to extract a meaningful result anyway. This error-mitigation technique could help quantum computers become more useful than their imperfect hardware would otherwise allow them to be. IBM's quantum computer had qubits made from tiny wires that conduct electricity perfectly. Superconducting qubits are typically programmed by being hit with pulses of microwaves, so running the new program was equivalent to programming a microwave pulse sequence.

    Previously, the team's largest meaningful quantum circuit used 26 qubits and contained 1080 individual operations. Now, the researchers have run a quantum circuit with 127 qubits and over 1700 individual operations.

  blurb: | 
    Quantum computing company Quantinuum made three more announcements at IEEE Quantum Week 2022. Announcements include another quantum volume record, a new method to make two-qubit gates with higher fidelity and greater efficiency, and a milestone achievement of more than a half-million downloads of its software.

    1. **Highlight 1: Shuttling ion pairs through intersections and negotiating 90 degree turns:** It may not sound significant, but this research provides the capability to execute Quantinuum’s long term roadmap for future generations of H-series quantum computers. Ion trap researchers have been working on this problem for years. Prior to Quantinuum’s research, it was believed that the only way for paired ions to move through zones was to first separate the pair, then move them through junctions one at a time. That solution would have significantly increased processing time.
    2. **Highlight 2: Closing the gap on fault-tolerant quantum error correction:** Fault tolerant quantum error correction will make it possible to build quantum computers with enough qubits to solve problems far beyond the reach of today's supercomputers. Quantinuum researchers were able to construct a logical entangling circuit that had a higher fidelity than its physical counterpart.
