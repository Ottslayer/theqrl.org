blurb: |
  The National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) warned that cyber actors could target our nation’s most sensitive information now and leverage future quantum computing technology to break traditional non-quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. This could be particularly devastating to sensitive information with long-term secrecy requirements.

   “The transition to a secured quantum computing era is a long-term intensive community effort that will require extensive collaboration between government and industry. **The key is to be on this journey today and not wait until the last minute.**”
