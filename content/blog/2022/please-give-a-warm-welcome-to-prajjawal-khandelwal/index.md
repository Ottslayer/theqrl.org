## Welcome

A warm welcome to Prajjawal who joined the team earlier this month and is working as a Software Development Engineer on project Zond (Proof-of-Stake/EVM). 

We put him on the spot with a few questions about his experience so far. 

### Why did you choose to work with the QRL project?

The primary motivation for me to join QRL was a strong team working towards the goal of shaping the future of blockchain technology and my personal inclination to experiment and research next-gen cryptographic algorithms.

### What is it like working on the cutting-edge intersection of cryptography and blockchain?

I am really glad for getting an opportunity to work with cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms and building the blockchain. Over the past few years, there have been a lot of advancements in both cryptography and blockchain technology and here at QRL we are bringing the best of both worlds and creating something that will create a high impact, I am very excited to see this happen.

### What excites you particularly about the project?

There will be a lot of developments and feature releases in the roadmap and something that excites me the most is the rollout of the PoS chain and EVM-compatible smart contract integration. We will be seeing quantum-proof decentralized apps in the future that will have mass adaptation due to security and safety.

### Is Kaushal a real human being or an AI?

Kaushal is a real human being and very supportive. He has been helping and guiding me  along the project so far.

(Ed -- still not convinced, sorry!)

Good luck with those unit tests while you grapple with the new `golang` codebase Prajjawal.
