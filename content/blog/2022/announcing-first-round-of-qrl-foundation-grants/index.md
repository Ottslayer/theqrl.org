## Calling all builders!

Observing as the crypto ecosystem has imploded with successive crises this year has been challenging. Bear markets are painful and seem to go on forever as the gift that keeps on giving. But in this difficult moment we are proud to go live with round 1 of the [QRL Grants Programme](https://qrl.foundation/grants.html). 

Anyone interested in applying should head over to the shiny new Foundation [website](https://qrl.foundation/grants.html) for more details. 

Whilst large grants for research, development and community will occur we also want to strongly encourage interested applicants to apply for small grants (up to CHF30000). Get involved in a cutting edge open source project. Help us build out the QRL ecosystem. Come and build on QRL to power the de facto post-quantum secure smart contract platform. Let us grow the nascent pq-web3 ecosystem together. 

If you are hesitant to apply then start a conversation with a team member or send us an email to discuss further informally! 

At a minimum the QRL Foundation is seeking to support a proliferation of at least ten projects with small grants over the next year. Remember, while the first round for large grants closes on 31/01/2023, small grant applications may be opened at any time throughout the year. 
 
## Next steps

The **first community grant** will be announced at the end of the year. Further announcements will follow as future applications are processed in Q1 2023. A list of active and previous awards will be maintained in the grants [register](https://qrl.foundation/reports.html) on the QRL Foundation site.

Great things get built during bear markets - so let's do it!
