A formalized role description is forthcoming.</p><p>Until then, if you feel you or someone you may know has what it takes to tackle the cutting edge collision of blockchain and quantum computers on the project that is educating and pioneering steps forward in this space, send an email to <a href="mailto:jobs@theqrl.org">jobs@theqrl.org</a>.</p><h3>enQlave audit is imminent</h3><p>We might have another Kaushal Kumar Singh on our hands who we’ve historically speculated might be part machine, part AI, and sometimes opined for a clone. Evidence of our search for clones can be found on our job post looking for <a href="https://angel.co/company/theqrl/jobs/638007-golang-developer">golang developers</a>!</p><p>Did we get what we want? Is Charlie Thompson a clone, or another person with an insatiable appetite for progress and work ethic that mimics that of a machine?</p><p>Work continues on steadily on enQlave with<strong> progress on a spectacular UI</strong> and <strong>lining up auditors</strong> to help ensure <strong>proper security is maintained</strong>. The auditors we spoke to last month have been advised it is a <strong>three week code audit — which should start imminently.</strong></p><h3>PoS back on track</h3><p>Proof-of-Stake is back in session with a devnet barebones coming soon with the aim of this month.</p><p>A separate medium blog will outline what to expect with and there’s a lot to say! Some questions from the community which we’ll cover is everything from what the minimum staking amount will be, to the type of PoS and how relevant our old PoS whitepaper is — which we look forward to answering.</p><p>If there’s any other questions on PoS, be sure to ask and we’ll make a note cover them.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2b9319fcf5e7" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-month-at-qrl-june-2020-2b9319fcf5e7">Last Month at QRL — June 2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Just like in other projects there is no CEO of the QRL. The foundation will support the development roadmap until such time as this process may be governed on-chain, which is in progress.</p><h4>Details</h4><p>Questions can be asked in several different ways up to July 3rd, 2020:</p><p><strong>For the <em>competition</em></strong></p><ol><li>Post the most technical question that’s relevant to QRL* on twitter with the tag #qrlama along with a link to the blog post or twitter mention @qrledger</li><li>The person with the most technical question posted that’s relevant* to QRL will be selected to win 1000 QRL.</li></ol><p>* Examples of relevant questions include our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-month-at-qrl-may-2020-ae03c3d34a78#46a8">current or upcoming features</a>, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391">post-quantum cryptography we use</a>, or quantum computing and how it will impact blockchain.</p><p><strong>Or ask in many other places</strong></p><ol><li>The QRL Discord channel <a href="https://discord.gg/6STmfFh">#qrlama</a></li><li>Wherever this announcement is <em>posted</em></li></ol><p><strong>From that</strong>, we’ll compile the questions and do our best to record them in an audio format and put that in a video on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2PP3kR9APyRUa9kRH8-uA">youtube channel</a> which will be posted on July 20th, 2020.</p><p>The results of a previous <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/ama-ask-me-anything-summary-b869e9239c79">AMA can be found here</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=76fac3ee7daa" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/announcing-qrl-ask-me-anything-ama-founder-peter-waterland-hosted-by-michael-strike-76fac3ee7daa">Announcing QRL Ask Me Anything (AMA) — Founder Peter Waterland, hosted by Michael Strike</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

href="https://qrl.foundation/">The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) Foundation</a> announced last month, <a href="https://www.enqlave.io">enQlave</a>, the worlds <em>first</em> Ethereum based post-quantum secure digital wallet.</p><p>If you didn’t catch it already, you can read an <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/enqlave-the-quantum-safe-for-your-crypto-assets-beaf9e933725">introduction to enQlave</a> by Peter Waterland or get more in depth with <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/the-qrl-enklave-project-bringing-post-quantum-security-to-ethereum-and-other-blockchain-platforms-31df477c543">Bringing Post-Quantum Security to Ethereum</a> by Charlie Thompson who summarizes it well with:</p><blockquote>QRL enQlave will bring the post-quantum security of XMSS (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391">eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme</a>) to mainnet Ethereum, and eventually to any other blockchain platform with sufficiently expressive smart contract capabilities.</blockquote><p>Beyond bringing the ability for any of the almost 100 million <a href="https://medium.com/u/d626b3859bc9">ethereum</a> unique addresses representing 31 billion in value in ETH alone post-quantum security, enQlave has the possibility to bring post-quantum security to the users of platforms such as <a href="https://medium.com/u/948dd45fd3d0">Tezos</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/628454c4bc31">eosio</a> with enough interest and sufficiently expressive smart-contract capabilities.</p><h4>Progress continues: Smart contract audit not far behind</h4><p>Right now there’s a working interface which allows you to sign transactions, add and replace any number of keys, and create Ethereum Quantum Resistant Tokens (eQRT).</p><p>The smart contract is just going through some final touches and is getting closer to a final review, which will be followed with an audit.</p><h3>QRL v2.0.5 release</h3><p>Release can be <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/releases/tag/v2.0.5">found on github</a> — it’s not a required update but it does give some special functionality!</p><h4>Google annotations for REST support for PublicAPI &amp; added google-api-python-client</h4><p>This will give anyone immediate URL address resolution to QRL’s PublicAPI without having to install, run and maintain separate server components.</p><p>Previously, by default, you’d have access to just the QRL node API, which is fine when you’re interfacing through terminal, but isn’t helpful when creating applications as it’s not as expressive and encourages the use of your languages exec functions, something that, depending on the language, can be more difficult to keep safe.</p><p>Soon you’ll be able to use a REST API to return useful information. If, <em>for example</em>, you install the node through pip3 and utilize envoy-proxy, to return the blockheight, the address would be <a href="https://127.0.0.1/state">https://127.0.0.1:7778/api/height</a></p><p>If you installed docker, this would be similar, but you’d need to get the IP address of your container.</p><h4>Other updates</h4><ul><li>Updated setuptools version to 46.4.0 &amp; protobuf to 3.6.0</li></ul><h3>qrl-cli updates</h3><p>The QRL-CLI has gone from v1.4.5 → 1.7.1 and added refinements, especially to our Ephemeral Messaging System (EMS) system.</p><h3>Secure Smart Addresses language foundation chosen: OCAML</h3><p>Hidden within the <a href="https://www.enqlave.io">enQlave announcement(s)</a> is that we’ve been working on bringing <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCAML</a> smart contracts to the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) platform for the next hardfork, Cesium.</p><p>From <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCAML</a>’s overview:</p><blockquote>[OCAML] is used in environments where <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html">a single mistake can cost millions and speed matters</a>. … It’s a safe language. Programs are verified by the compiler before they can be executed, which rules out many programming errors, such as, for instance, confusing an integer for a pointer, or accessing a nonexistent field in a record.</blockquote><h3>QIP012: Suggestion for transaction replay protection</h3><p><strong>Whilst currently an extremely low risk vulnerability</strong>, replay attack protection should ideally be considered and implemented in the next hard fork to completely mitigate this attack vector.</p><p>The attack scenario involves a transaction from one blockchain network being relayed to another through a malicious node. This is something possible between QRL Testnet and QRL Mainnet, however, it is not recommended to use the same QRL XMSS account on both testnet and mainnet due to the potential risk of OTS re-use.</p><p>Where this becomes more pertinent is when there’s an increase of multiple existing chains persisting where people are more likely to either confuse what chain they’re on, or be inclined to switch between chains and reuse accounts. The chance of such a scenario happening will increase as more interest is accumulated and with certain forking events, such as the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.</p><p>Some proposed solutions in the QIP are:</p><p><strong>network ID</strong> — A unique numerical identifier, nodes on each network would find any transaction not using the correct identifier invalid. An example would be &#39;0000&#39; = devnet, &#39;0001&#39; = testnet, &#39;0002&#39; = mainnet, &#39;0003&#39; = mainnet pos, or simply stamping the genesis block hash into each transaction. Note this does not prevent replay attacks in later forks of a network using the same identifier.</p><p><strong>block hash</strong> — each block in the chain has a unique hash value obtained from aggregating and hashing the block header (and incorporating the previous block header hash). Thus, stamping each transaction with the a recent 32 byte block header hash is a simple way of preventing a replay attack. The significant downside is this requires the transaction signer to know something about the current QRL chain which could be a problem for offline transaction signing. Another consideration is that choosing the most recent block could lead to a transaction entering the mempool only for the block to be discarded in a mini-fork and then the transaction become invalid. It would make sense then to choose a block hash at a given depth from the tip of the chain or specific epoch blocks at 1k intervals (or something suitable).</p><p><strong>tx hash</strong> — it is possible for each transaction to optionally include the txhash of the last transaction from the account. It would therefore force an attacker to replay all historical transactions since the fork to achieve success — if there are no transactions since the fork then this would not be effective at preventing a replay attack.</p><p>While this subject has been previously discussed at length by the core development team, we would like to thank <a href="https://red4sec.com/en">red4sec</a> (who <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/red4sec-security-audit-concludes-a-summary-563ecfe04c75">performed one of our audits</a>) for reminding us.</p><p>QIP012&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/25/files?short_path=6fdf8c6#diff-6fdf8c6fc91383d3892ca9efd19a6cd9">overview</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/25">discussion</a> can be found on github.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ae03c3d34a78" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-month-at-qrl-may-2020-ae03c3d34a78">Last month at QRL — May 2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The QRL enQlave Project — Bringing Post-Quantum Security to Ethereum</h3><h4>QRL’s Smart Contracts will bring the post-quantum security of XMSS (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391">eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme</a>) to mainnet Ethereum, and eventually to any other blockchain platform with sufficiently expressive smart contract capabilities.</h4><p><strong>tl;dr </strong>The QRL enQlave Project will:</p><ul><li>Enable Ethereum users to protect their ETH and ERC-20 balances from the risk of a quantum computer attack, using Smart Contracts on mainnet Ethereum.</li><li>Enable the bi-directional migration of Quanta (QRL’s token) between QRL ←→ Ethereum and eventually any blockchain network with sufficient smart contract capabilities.</li><li>Enable the creation of post-quantum secure tokens on mainnet Ethereum (Ethereum Quantum Resistant Tokens, or “eQRTs”).</li></ul><p>Where possible, the QRL team has built off of <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin">OpenZeppelin primitives</a> in order to make trust / audits easier. <strong><em>It should be noted that the transaction costs for these functions are currently very high.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Slightly more involved tl;dr:</strong></p><p>There will be one “XMSS Registry” Contract which keeps a mapping (think: a phone book) of Ethereum addresses ←→ XMSS public keys. This contract will deploy a unique instance of a PQ-secure multi-signature wallet for any individual caller who provides an XMSS public key. The XMSS key will serve as an additional layer of protection for any funds stored in the PQ-secure multi-signature wallet, and once deposited, funds will only be able to be moved by a valid transaction from the associated Ethereum address + a valid XMSS signature (verified by the “XMSS Registry” contract) on the details of the desired transaction.</p><p>In addition to this protection functionality, the main “XMSS Registry” contract will also be able to deploy “eQRTs” (Ethereum Quantum Resistant Tokens). These tokens provide all the functionality in the ERC-20 specification, but can only be sent between users with associated XMSS public keys (upon successful XMSS signature verification).</p><p><em>It should be noted that the transaction costs for these functions are very high,</em><strong><em> </em></strong>although we are working to optimize the contracts and otherwise bring the gas cost down. At this stage, it makes sense primarily to secure ETH and ERC-20s from the risk of a quantum-computer attack when the funds do not need to be moved frequently. An XMSS signature verification could cost upwards of 5M gas (anywhere from $2-$16, depending on network congestion and desired speed, at current ETH/average gwei rates), making frequent outbound transactions from a PQ-secure multi-sig wallet expensive. The QRL Foundation will pursue a third-party audit of our code before deploying it to the main network.</p><blockquote>The QRL Foundation foresees a world where global and digital economies rely on blockchain networks, and believes that before digital securities can be issued — or before ownership of assets can be widely tokenized in general — organizations and individuals will need to be certain that their digital assets cannot be compromised by a sudden advance in quantum-computing technology. Today, that guarantee is only available on the QRL main network, which has been operational, secure, and third-party audited since the summer of 2018.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xszcNzQ6zibFBxQ3" /><figcaption>An early design diagram of the enQlave system</figcaption></figure><p>A primary design requirement was to keep track of XMSS public keys and signatures — one quirk of XMSS (and the main aspect which prevents it from being a silver-bullet replacement for today’s internet public-key security infrastructure) is its “stateful” nature. An XMSS public key actually represents a “tree” of One-Time Signature (OTS) keys, meaning that a user’s security could be compromised if they were to sign two different messages with the same OTS key. In ECDSA and other common digital signature algorithms, there is no notion of “multiple” keys (aside from public-private), and you can not “run out” of signatures.</p><p><strong><em>XMSSAccount Management:</em></strong></p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/b6509ce77c71a4dc99735d579ed28012/href">https://medium.com/media/b6509ce77c71a4dc99735d579ed28012/href</a></iframe><p>The implication of XMSS’s stateful nature for the QRL enQlave project is that the OTS index (the next free One-time Signature to be used) is a crucial value for each XMSS public key, which must be strictly tracked and maintained. In our contracts, if you use up an OTS but the transaction otherwise fails (if the value argument supplied was greater than the balance of your PQ-secure multisig, for example), you have still used up one OTS key.</p><p>As a result of being able to “run out” of signatures, there exists a need to be able to “replace” an XMSS public key which has run out of One-Time Signatures. We have designed our contracts so that a user can only use their last OTS in order to replace their current XMSS public key, thus providing a guarantee that nobody can be “locked out” and that there is a way for users to replenish their supply of One-Time Signatures to make transactions with. The default tree-height of an XMSS public key generated using QRL’s interface allows for 1024 such OTS / transactions.</p><p><strong><em>Functions for “Typical” and “Power” users:</em></strong></p><p>Another design decision was to accommodate a wide range of potential users. While recognizing that most users will be well-served by a single XMSS public key (with a default of 1024 OTS), we wanted to design our contracts to be future-proof in every way possible. As a result, we have included functionality for “power users” — potential future users (exchanges, businesses deploying security tokens, etc) who might want to have more than one XMSS public key associated with their Ethereum address, or those who might want to make an XMSSAccount without deploying the PQ-Secure multisig (those who only want to use eQRT functionality, for example, where the token never “leaves” the eQRT contract to be “stored” in another Ethereum address).</p><p>This flexibility was accomplished by using Solidity’s function overloading capabilities. For every user-facing function, there are two versions — one for the typical user, and one for the power user (where additional relevant arguments can be passed in). As is standard programming practice, each of these duplicate functions in turn calls the same internal function with separate parameters to eliminate code duplication.</p><p><strong><em>eQRTs:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*8SSMzQAuLTJTRcvv" /><figcaption>Inside the constructor of the “Registry” Contract, an eQRTFactory is deployed</figcaption></figure><p>All generated eQRTs (deployed by a linked “eQRTFactory”) refer back to the main XMSS registry account for XMSS signature verification.</p><p>The deployers of eQRTs will be able to (optionally) leverage the advantages of GSN (the “Gas Station Network”), which allows for “meta-transactions”. In other words, someone will be able to interact with the eQRT contract from an ethereum address with 0 ETH (not enough to cover even small transaction fees), because the eQRT contract will be able to pay for such transactions (according to the deployer’s arbitrary criteria / GSN “strategy”). This was included for future-proofing purposes, because it significantly eases the onboarding process of certain applications.</p><p><strong><em>OpenZeppelin:</em></strong></p><p>Where possible, we have used primitives and building blocks provided by OpenZeppelin. An example is our ERC-20 code — we use the already-audited implementation provided by OpenZeppelin, with the only modification being a requirement for a valid XMSS signature before processing certain transactions.</p><p>It is our hope that this will make auditing our code easier. We would like to thank OpenZeppelin for the extremely valuable open-source infrastructure they have built.</p><p><strong><em>Moving Forward:</em></strong></p><p>As a part of making this tool accessible to members of the QRL and Ethereum communities, we are developing a web-interface and will work towards integration with the Nano Ledger family of devices (a feature many users of both QRL and Ethereum are accustomed to).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/769/1*D_kDQt8eZSMue5WjC3IrLQ.gif" /><figcaption>An alpha-stage version of the front-end in action</figcaption></figure><p>QRL’s primary focus is security, and we will uphold the same technical rigor that has gone into the other parts of our ecosystem (the cryptography and blockchain implementations, respectively) to this venture. We will obtain and release a third-party audit before deploying our contracts to the Ethereum mainnet. We hope that this tool can provide value for Ethereum users and bring wider awareness to the pioneering work of the QRL project in the realm of digital asset security.</p><p><strong>An introduction to the author:</strong></p><p>I am a core QRL dev who joined the team in 12/2019 and am very excited for the future of QRL and Ethereum. If you have any questions about these Smart Contracts, or the system as a whole, feel free to tag me at @dr_gonzo in the QRL discord.</p><p><em>A final note: a significant portion of the heavy-lifting on this project — the EVM-assembly-optimized XMSS Signature verification code — was performed by longtime QRL developer Kaushal Singh (Ed — is he human or machine?).</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=31df477c543" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/the-qrl-enklave-project-bringing-post-quantum-security-to-ethereum-and-other-blockchain-platforms-31df477c543">The QRL Enqlave Project — Bringing Post-Quantum Security to Ethereum and other blockchain platforms</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And quantum risk grows with higher crypto asset valuations looming and QC development beginning to bear fruit.</p><p>Whilst our development team works to integrate OCAML smart contracts into our next fork — very exciting as this introduces amazing functionality — we have been working on a tangential move since the end of 2019 to bring the QRL to a much wider audience and raise the profile of the project considerably with a new wallet called <strong>enQlave </strong>.</p><h3>What is it?</h3><p>EnQlave wallet is an Ethereum Webwallet which allows any user to secure their ether or erc20 token balances from quantum theft.</p><p>It also brings the very first post-quantum secure token to Ethereum — which of course is the QRL.</p><h3>Why Ethereum?</h3><p>Ethereum is the first platform we have chosen for enQlave to natively support. The reason for this is largely down to the maturity of the EVM, the size of the existing userbase, and the combined market cap of Ethereum and erc20-based projects (currently 45 of the top 100 on CMC).</p><p>In our first iteration we will be able to offer post-quantum security to a very significant unprotected percentage of the entire crypto asset space. If we gain traction we will add support to other promising smaller smart contract platforms such as Tezos, EOS, Stellar etc.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>Through a simple UI and compatible with the ledger hardware wallet, enQlave is a non-custodial hybrid post-quantum secure multi-sig Ethereum wallet (quite a mouthful).</p><p>Behind the scenes, each wallet instance creates a smart contract on Ethereum and generates a unique post-quantum secure contract address. This is your enQlave wallet address and with it you may receive ether or erc20 tokens like any normal Ethereum address.</p><p>The magic begins when you move funds out of the wallet.</p><p>A normal address requires you to simply sign a transaction with your ethereum private key to move funds— something done under the hood by your wallet software or hardware wallet.</p><p>Moving funds out of your post-quantum secure contract address requires both a standard Ethereum ECDSA signature but also an XMSS signature from an XMSS public key linked during the setup phase.</p><p>The enQlave wallet signs each outbound transaction with both ECDSA and XMSS — potentially from one or more hardware wallets depending upon your security paranoia level.</p><p>Without both valid signatures no funds can leave your enQlave address and so the enQlave wallet is ultra cold storage — <strong><em>removing the future risk of quantum threat for the first time in an address you can re-use at will</em></strong>.</p><h3>Wait did you say XMSS on ethereum?</h3><p>Using assembly optimisation we have managed to code functional XMSS signature verification on ethereum. To squish the computation down as much as possible we have stretched the signature size compared with the QRL mainnet.</p><p>It has a gas heavy per transaction cost but for an ultra cold storage solution potentially securing billions of dollars of crypto assets we do not see this as a problem.</p><h3>QRL back on ethereum?</h3><p>With the ability to verify XMSS signatures on ethereum comes the need to track XMSS tree state. To do this we have designed and built an XMSS registry smart contract on ethereum which allows the potential for XMSS powered tokens to run natively on ethereum.</p><p>The first and only planned such post-quantum secure token is QRL. We will be adding an easy way to hop your QRL between the native QRL webwallet and an enQlave ethereum wallet address (or visa versa) and a blog post detailing the mechanics of this bridge is coming in the near future.</p><h3>Can I see the prototype?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Sf9TQYn9L3v2si9DZvePJg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*95Afxvvut7wI35JDEJZjGQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/555/1*U-_9qQ2AwSllFc9Qos8pzg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/559/1*tBPjjFOtbN8LPYnYr0pjBg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VbV7E47ki_rvjpDk0c8XSw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/527/1*LHADqouPalb7gSHLT3RB-w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/511/1*x4KhWKtk77zovV7l9jLo0w.png" /><figcaption>Unskinned prototype front end</figcaption></figure><p>Here are some screenshots from the latest build which is currently running on a private Ethereum network. Remember this is as yet unskinned and the final appearance will change considerably as we move towards production, beautify things and simplify the UI.</p><h3>What is left before this reaches production?</h3><p>A smart contract audit, some ledger integration and lots of testing before we move to Ethereum mainnet.</p><h3>Can I take a deep dive into how this works?</h3><p>As always our code will be open source and our repo will soon be going public on github in our theqrl repo.</p><p>A video detailing the backend mechanics can be seen <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420287807">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>MMP OS: Miner management made easy</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*GML4ND2rZXw4ij8IRh82EQ.png" /></figure><p>It’s possible to mine QRL with XMRIG on your <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/mining/">Windows or Linux machine</a>, but if you want to expand your mining operation to more than one machine, it’s useful to look into mining platforms like <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/">MMP OS</a> — <strong>which we’re now happy to be supported on!</strong></p><p><a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/">MMP OS</a> gives you the ability to manage multiple different computers (mining rigs) from the comfort of your browser window.</p><p>The things you can do from one location includes:</p><ul><li>Status updates for each mining rig. Easily glean the overall status, power usage, hashrate, temperature and other key indicators of a healthy mining rig</li><li>Ability to disable or restart the miner.</li><li>Sum hashrate and average shares of all mining rigs</li><li>Add/remove/reconfigure mining pools</li><li>Add/remove/reconfigure wallets</li><li>Add/remove/reconfigure mining profiles</li></ul><p>In short, the MMP (Miner Management Platform) and the corresponding <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/">MMP OS</a> makes managing mining QRL a breeze.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O3TC-yc5Gs0gNyDs6DenwA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Manage your QRL mining empire on the go from your phone!</figcaption></figure><p>While MMP OS makes things as easy as possible, there’s still a few more steps involved in getting everything setup than with your local xmrig configuration. In this guide, we’re going to get setup on Windows, but it’s possible to get everything setup on Linux as well with the same principles applied here.</p><h4>Step 1: Signup</h4><p>Go to <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/register">https://app.mmpos.eu/register</a> and register.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4vKGdsu-8pLvyMPz_Ft0DA.png" /></figure><h4>Step 2: Login and download the Windows Agent</h4><p>You’ll get two options here, one is to download <em>mmpOS </em>or the <em>Windows Agent</em>. This guide is going to take you through installing the Windows Agent, but if you’re setting up multiple rigs, you’ll want to get mmpOS.</p><p>After downloading, extract the contents of the zip folder and click on ‘agent’. This agent will be listening for commands we give it later in this guide. Leave it open.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YeEulCVJbQoj9vg7vZS_GA.png" /></figure><h4>Step 3: Create a QRL Wallet and get its Address</h4><p>You can follow our documentation guide, but it should be straightforward to go to <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">https://wallet.theqrl.org</a> and create a wallet there.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DGs0f3mOth1delc6bgvN5w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y9EmSa0e4B7kmV-ZKqiNaQ.png" /></figure><h4>Step 4: Add wallet address to mmpOS</h4><p>Click on wallets in the sidebar of the mmpOS web interface or go to <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/wallets/">https://app.mmpos.eu/wallets</a> to add a wallet. Make sure you select “Quantum Resistant Ledger”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VK82Wqn10Ml7_pwoWNTWYw.png" /></figure><h4>Step 5: Add a pool</h4><p>Click on pools in the sidebar of the web mmpOS interface or go to <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/pools/">https://app.mmpos.eu/pools/</a> to and click Add Pool in the top right hand corner.</p><p>You can find pool information in our documentation at <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/pools/">https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/pools/</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EXY67Kx-cO8TUIh2Kk0UDQ.png" /></figure><h4>Step 6: Add a miner profile</h4><p>A miner profile combines a miner with a pool selected. Because your miner is going to be on Windows and we’re mining with randomx, change the platform to <em>Windows </em>and Miner to <em>xmrig randomx</em>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E6WIAATXpxJJWVyGGowyGQ.png" /></figure><h4>Step 7: Add a mining rig</h4><p>If you haven’t already, launch the agent from the extracted folder in Step 2</p><p>Then go to rigs in the sidebar of the web mmpOS interface or visit <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/rigs">https://app.mmpos.eu/rigs</a> and click on <em>Add rig</em>.</p><p>Because the agent is on the same system, you should be able to automatically register it by clicking on “Automatically register”. When you do so, you should see activity in your agent console window.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4QUkx67BSSYL24SvId8MKg.png" /></figure><h4>Step 8: Configure the miner rig</h4><p>Click on your mining rig name and make sure everything is setup correctly. If no mining profile is selected, select the one you made earlier.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*91TrViuJSL7BUcs5mRzv5w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E0j6PBsdHE69QeIGawQniw.png" /></figure><h4>Step 9: That should be it!</h4><p>The agent will download the selected miner and start mining. After a few minutes, you’ll start to see charts display.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Qzz5oXKQ82eX1j-pdApCWw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uIXaPU6mbK7iSAh-N29FaA.png" /></figure><h4>Step 10: Stuck? Get help</h4><p>mmpOS has a <a href="https://discord.gg/P5J6Z5h">discord </a>and <a href="https://t.me/mmpos_intl">telegram</a> with people that are always willing to help.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dc28d8e6693e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/new-mining-platform-integration-and-guide-mine-qrl-on-mmp-os-dc28d8e6693e">New mining platform integration and guide: Mine QRL on MMP OS</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
