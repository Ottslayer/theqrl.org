## Other ways to acquire QRL

### Mining

QRL uses the CPU friendly RandomX Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to mine and can be mined by setting [mining to a pool](https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/mining/)(easy) or setting up a [mining node](https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/full-node/)(advanced).

For extra mining power, some people like to rent extra hashrate from a service like [nicehash](https://nicehash.com/) and pointing that hashrate to a pool.
