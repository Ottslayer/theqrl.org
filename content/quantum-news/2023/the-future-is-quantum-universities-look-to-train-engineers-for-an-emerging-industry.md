The University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia has recently introduced a novel academic programme: a quantum engineering undergraduate degree.

Students are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to enter the burgeoning quantum-technology sector, which has initiated the development of devices employing quantum-property-exhibiting components such as individual atoms, electrons, photons, and others. Numerous industries are placing bets on the potential advantages that the forthcoming quantum computing revolution will bring.
