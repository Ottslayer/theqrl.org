  A Chinese company has made a 72-qubit superconducting quantum chip with foreign machines as the United States's curbs failed to slow China's development in this area.

  Origin Quantum, a Hefei-based quantum computer maker, on January 6 officially launched its third-generation quantum computer called Wukong, which uses the name of the Monkey King in Chinese mythology as the superhero can transform into 72 different forms.
