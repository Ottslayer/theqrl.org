Attacks on large corporations are increasingly sophisticated, and Cryptosense, a French startup specializing in cryptographic security, addresses these vulnerabilities by providing software that detects and corrects cryptography misuse. Recently acquired by California-based SandboxAQ to bolster its post-quantum cryptography solutions, Cryptosense originated from the French National Institute for Computer Science Research (Inria) and was founded in 2013. The acquisition aims to enhance SandboxAQ’s cybersecurity capabilities, especially in preparation for the advent of quantum computing, which poses significant risks to current cryptographic methods.

Amadeus Capital Partners, an investor in Cryptosense, emphasized the importance of transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography and highlighted Cryptosense's unique ability to analyze both source code and runtime cryptography implementations. This acquisition will allow SandboxAQ to expand its global footprint, accelerating the deployment of its post-quantum cryptography solutions. Despite moving under U.S. ownership, Cryptosense’s team will remain in France and the U.K., contributing to SandboxAQ’s broader reach and customer base in Europe and the U.S. The move reflects a trend of mergers and acquisitions in the quantum technology sector, driven by the need for rapid development and deployment of advanced cryptographic solutions.
