A reward fund of up to 25,000 QRL is available, with the final total prize pool dependent on the quantity, quality, and effort of the projects submitted. Some of this pool will go towards QRL Hearty's, which you can read more about on our [Getting Started](../start) page.

For more information on the latter, be sure to check out our judging section of our [Rules & Guidelines](../rules) page.
