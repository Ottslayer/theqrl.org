title: "Proof of Stake"
---

**Proof-of-Stake** is a blockchain consensus mechanism that will be replacing Proof-of-Work in QRL. Instead of computers competing for who would win the block by computing a piece of work, a validator is selected at random by the weight of their holdings.

QRL currently has a post-quantum secure Proof-of-Stake devnet and [code](https://github.com/theQRL/zond), codenamed [project Zond](/blog/project-zond-qrls-proof-of-stake-code-is-released-to-the-public/) which lays out some of the framework that may be used for our upcoming proof-of-stake system. With the aim to provide the most reliable, efficient, and flexible, post-quantum secure proof-of-stake protocol, additional competing areas of [research](/categories/research) and development are being pursued between STARKs (with hash-based cryptography), and lattice-based cryptographic solutions.
