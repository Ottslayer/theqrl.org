blurb: "Cloudflare has launched post-quantum cryptography support for all websites
  and APIs served through its network. This will introduce quantum computer-proof
  encryption for all sites using Cloudflare, which accounts for 19.1% of all websites
  according to W3Techs. Researchers estimate the market for such solutions will be
  worth $476.8 million by 2030. \n\nCloudflare isn't the only CDN provider looking
  to secure the Internet from quantum computing threats. Other vendors like PQShield,
  which announced raising $20 million in funding earlier this year, are leveraging
  post-quantum cryptography to enable enterprises to develop secure cryptographic
  solutions for messaging platforms, apps and mobile technologies. \n"
