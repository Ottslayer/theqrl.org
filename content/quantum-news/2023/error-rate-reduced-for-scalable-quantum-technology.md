blurb: |
  Researchers have made significant progress in improving the accuracy of a technology used to control quantum bits (qubits), which is essential for scaling up quantum computers. The technology uses flux quanta, units of magnetic flux, to control superconducting qubits. By physically separating the qubits from the control circuits, researchers achieved an accuracy above 99%. This development could provide a more scalable and practical pathway to quantum computation. Further refinements could potentially increase the accuracy even more. The improvement addresses a major obstacle in the development of large-scale quantum computers, which requires accurate results in the presence of environmental noise.
