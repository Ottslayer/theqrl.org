The QRL Hackathon 2022 is a great place for developers, artists, writers, or anyone else alike to come together for an intimate multi-day event with direct team interaction and to be part of the future of post-quantum resistant blockchain ecosystems.

Head on over to our [Getting Started](/events/qrl-hackathon-2022/start/) page to join in the fun today.

### Key Focuses

Alongside the Hackathon itself, we'll be launching PoS/Smart contracts in addition and announcing a grant program.

### Wait, There's More

As part of the Hackathon event, we’ll also be hosting an exclusive fireside chat, holding a number of lightning talks throughout each day, providing QRL swag, rewards, and you’ll get a chance to have your very own proof-of-attendance coin (limited run).

### Have A Question About Attending?

If you have any questions, we're happy to answer them through [support@theqrl.org](mailto:support@theqrl.org) or our [Discord](https://www.theqrl.org/discord) channels.
