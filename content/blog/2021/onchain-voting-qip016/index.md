## Extended guide

### Step 0: Make sure your funds are in the appropriate spot

If your funds are on an exchange, you'll need to remove them before November 2nd, 2021 or they wont get counted in the voting snapshot!

You'll need to [create your own wallet](/downloads). Once you do that, *verify* you can open your wallet by closing it and opening it again.

After that, send the funds from an exchange to your wallet.

### Step 1: Be familiar with the neutral, positive, and negative considerations

Head over to our [pre-vote synopsis](/blog/qip016-reduce-emission-rate-of-the-network-prevote-synopsis/) and read it for an overview.

Lots may have been discussed since then, so it's recommended to join the conversation happening in our [Discord](/discord) community.

### Step 2: Head over to vote.theqrl.org

On [vote.theqrl.org](https://vote.theqrl.org), you'll be presented by a page that outlines the voting parameters, voting options, progress, and a way to check the status of your vote.

### Step 3: Send the message transaction

{{< image "./images/vote.sendmessage.gif" >}}

With the hash outlined in the vote options on [vote.theqrl.org](https://vote.theqrl.org), open up your wallet at [wallet.theqrl.org](https://wallet.theqrl.org) and go to tools -> message transaction.

### Step 4: Verify that your vote was successful

Head back to [vote.theqrl.org](https://vote.theqrl.org) and go to the address check portion of the page. There you'll find a place to copy in your address to check to see whether your vote was counted.

Please note, that it can take up to 24 hours for the vote index to catch up and register. If your vote isn't registered, be sure to return the next day. If you're vote still isn't registered by then, you can reach out to support@theqrl.org and we'll be able to help.

### Step 5: Celebrate

Your vote has successfully been tallied into the fabric of time. It's possible people will look back on this day and see this as a historic moment in history that you were part of!

## Instructions to vote for Ledger Nano S/X

## Frequently asked questions

### I have my funds on an exchange, can I vote?

You will need to take your funds **off** of an exchange before the snapshot blockheight.

### I have my funds on my mobile wallet, can I vote?

Yes, though you'll need to export your private key to vote.

### I have my funds on my ledger, can I vote?

Open your ledger from the desktop wallet like you normally would, and make a message transaction from the information found at https://vote.theqrl.org.

### What happens after the vote?

As per our QIP process, we'll be evaluating the outcome and make a public determination based on the votes and other considerations.

### How many votes are required for the Proposal to pass?

QIP voting parameters are evaluated on a case by case basis. As this is dealing with the core economics of the QRL blockchain, greater than 50% of the eligible votes (where 1 QRL = 1 vote) are required to pass ([Qualified majority voting](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/9-503-0498)).

For QIP 016, eligible votes are `circulating_population - exchanges - foundation`, or about `55.71m` QRL. Half of that would be roughly `27.85m` to pass. Of course, the final values are determined based on the blockheight the snapshot is made.
