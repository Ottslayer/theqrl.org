The QRL Foundation is committed to supporting high-quality original research in post-quantum secure cryptography and blockchain applications.

We have active crypto-research projects underway in:

- Quantum Resistant Proof-of-Stake
- Lattice-based ZK systems
- ZK-Starks

See our [Citations, Standards, Cryptography and Recommended Technical Reading](/research/citations) section for details of the building body of academic literature around QRL and its associated cryptographic ecosystem.

Third party audits into our codebase are published in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/theQRL/audits).

Our [Grants](/research/grants) page lists open grants.
