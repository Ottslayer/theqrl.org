## Community

### Languages

[Last week](/blog/last-week-in-qrl-april-9-15th) we started rolling out language channels in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DfaNhM) with the assistance of qrlbutler and [Google Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/). So far we have [Russian](https://discord.gg/qFU3AGW) and [Spanish](https://discord.gg/AcSjhug) channels, with more to come in the following weeks.

While this is presently landlocked to Discord, the full intent is that it will eventually reach beyond that, to most social media platforms.

### Contributors

{{< image "./images/1YedlovyTwfSINRvLuMCdyg.png" >}}

You may have noticed our latest major site update included a contributors section — but not all contributors write code. Some of the best contributions to the QRL ecosystem have come in the form of artwork, the written word, constructive feedback, and outreach. While we’ve recognized these contributors in the form of *nominations*, we wanted the opportunity to highlight them in another way.

In addition to that, there’s been a small group of people working behind the scenes, doing an amazing job helping us bring the project to a wider audience. The discussions have been fruitful, and allowed us to access a distilled perspective, from those who are truly passionate about the network.

These things have been in motion for some time, but we will be able to say more publicly in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!

## Developments

### Testing for GO-QRL

Internal testing has commenced for GO-QRL. In the coming weeks, this will go out to #TestPilots — including some documentation and a call for more public testing!

### Final stages of the mobile wallet

We’re on the cusp of a release — as soon as we get Apple’s approval. We know many have been waiting for this to happen, as it completes our ecosystem of front-line products.

### QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities

IMac has put together a QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) for the tokenization of securities.
> **Abstract**
> One of the biggest potential use cases of blockchains in the future is the tokenization of existing securities to be bought and sold by valid parties. Being the only existing blockchain that is quantum resistant from genesis and adding the functionality of smart contracts, QRL is in a unique spot to capitalize on this opportunity. The QRL team should evaluate whether the functionality of the smart contracts that are currently in progress can support the tokenization of securities on the QRL blockchain. If that is not the case, the team should consider adding additional functionality that allows for such tokenization.

More can be read in the [Pull Request](https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/d0e94bdcca23e5e2a66ca372dc02186c987bc8b8/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/7%20-%20Support%20Tokenization%20of%20Securities/README.md).
