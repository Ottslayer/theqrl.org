blurb: |
  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is hosting Aquila by [QuEra](https://www.quera.com/), the first publicly available neutral atom quantum computer on [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/).

  For Aquila's 256-bit neutral-atom quantum processor, Qubits are laser developed in a vacuum chamber, where a cloud of rubidium atoms is trapped by magnetic fields. Laser light then is used to capture individual atoms of that cloud, holding them like tweezers, and constraining their motion so that they are effectively chilled to close to absolute zero.
