## Our current entries

In light of our [recent QRL refresh](/blog/new-qrl-website-and-logo-refresh-in-celebration-of-nists-approval-of-xmss/), we have been holding a QRL Refresh Merchandise Design contest which has been exclusive to the community, but there's been some great entries so far which the QRL core contributors have been enjoying too much to not share!

{{< image "./images/tshirts.png" >}}

The selected winners will have their design placed on our teespring store ([EU](https://teespring.com/stores/quantum-resistant-ledger-eu), and [NA](https://teespring.com/stores/quantum-resistant-ledger-na)) with a link back to their store to earn passively. Of course, these links will remain here (and be updated with new entries) as the contest
