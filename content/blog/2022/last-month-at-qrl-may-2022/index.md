## Highlights

### QRL Hackathon 2022 Location & Date

{{< image "./images/hl.hackathon.png" >}}

The city of Amsterdam will play host to the QRL Hackathon 2022, and it is with great pleasure that we are able to share this information with you.

- **When:**  
  September 21 - 22, 2022 
  (Wednesday, Thursday)
- **Where:**  
  Atrium Meeting Centre  
  Strawinskylaan 3001  
  1077 ZX Amsterdam

There we'll be reveailing the future of post-quantum resistant blockchains, an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake driven public blockchain with a fully decentralised network, offering users provably post-quantum secure transactions and Turing complete smart contract capabilities.

Opening the door to provably-quantum secure Web3 functionality enables new and uniquely secure use-cases such as: dApps, DeFi applications, quantum-secure stablecoins, NFTs, eternal quantum-secure contracts, and metaverse applications. Choosing to implement the EVM into the QRL protocol enables smart contract compatibility and interoperability with other EVM chains.

## Advocacy & Education

### Techniques for efficient post-quantum finance (part 3: Adaptor Signatures)

[The QRL Foundation](https://qrl.foundation/) and [Geometry Labs](https://www.geometrylabs.io) was happy to release the third article in a multipart series in constructing scalable post-quantum finance. In this article, we explore the [novel one-time adaptor signature scheme](/blog/techniques-for-efficient-post-quantum-finance-part-3-adaptor-signatures), designed to enable payment channels and decentralized trustless cross-chain atomic swaps (QRL↔BTC, QRL↔ETH, QRL↔ZEC, etc.)

### Video Miniseries: What exactly is the quantum threat to Bitcoin?

Quantum computing has the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies in modern history. Whereas Bitcoin is currently secure, a sufficiently powerful enough quantum computer would render it vulnerable in its current form. 

In order to help educate those becoming familiar with this quantum threat to Bitcoin, we've broke the issues down into a three part mini-series which covers the quantum threat to Bitcoin in a simple, easy to understand fashion.

#### Part 1: Bitcoin addressing

{{< youtube "or7gNPbbtAo" >}}

The first episode takes a dive into the signing of transactions and signatures on Bitcoin, the most important thing to understand when we're talking about the Quantum Threat.

#### Part 2: Quantum computers

{{< youtube "bjcKEhXxiS8" >}}

Once signatures are understood, we look at quantum computers and how Shor's algorithm can take the public key and derive your private key from it.

#### Part 3: Quantum Resistant Ledger

Finally, we cover what QRL is all about and how it differs from Bitcoin to protect itself from the emerging threat of quantum computing.

## Quantum developments

### IBM’s Newest Quantum Computing Roadmap Unveils Four New Quantum Processors And Future Plans For A Quantum Supercomputer

{{< image "./images/ibm.jpg" >}}

> Last week IBM updated its quantum computing roadmap for the third time since the first one was published in 2020. In this roadmap, IBM has effectively introduced new and essential technologies at every layer of the stack. It has also provided new tools for kernel developers, algorithm developers, and model developers. These developments all require new hardware, software, and new architecture.
> 
> This roadmap suggests that IBM will accelerate quantum's expected trajectory by developing quantum processors that have the potential to scale to hundreds of thousands of qubits several years earlier than expected. - [forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2022/05/18/ibms-newest-quantum-computing-roadmap-unveils-four-new-quantum-processors-and-future-plans-for-a-quantum-supercomputer/?sh=6358b3587ebd)

### Error-free quan­tum com­put­ing gets real

{{< image "./images/errorfree.jpg" >}}

> Quantum computers always require error correction mechanisms as they are more susceptible to disturbances. Redundancy can be achieved by dispersing logical quantum information into an entangled state of different physical systems, such as multiple individual atoms because quantum physics’s fundamental laws prohibit copying quantum information.
>
> Now, a team of scientists has, for the first time, successfully realized a set of computational operations on two logical qubits. - [techexplorist](https://www.techexplorist.com/error-free-quantum-computing-gets-real/47663/)

### Nvidia Aims to Bridge the GPU and Quantum Computing Realms via cuQuantum

{{< image "./images/nvidia.webp" >}}

> Nvidia is accelerating its efforts to bridge the GPU and quantum computing realms through cuQuantum, its Tensor-capable (opens in new tab)quantum simulation toolkit. Through it, the company aims to accelerate quantum circuit simulation workloads in ways that are beyond the reach of today's NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) systems. But for that to happen, the company is betting on further integration between quantum and classical systems towards hybrid solutions. Unsurprisingly, GPUs are at the forefront of Nvidia's quantum developments. - [tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-cuquantum-computing)
