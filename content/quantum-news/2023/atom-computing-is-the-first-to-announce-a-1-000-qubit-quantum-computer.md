title: Atom Computing is the first to announce a 1,000+ qubit quantum computer

blurb: |
  Atom Computing announced that it has been doing internal testing of a 1,180 qubit quantum computer to be available to customers next year. This system represents a major step forward, from a system that operated only 100 qubits.

  While it won't be possible to run an algorithm that relies on a full qubit count without failing due to an error, it represents that the technology can scale rapidly and provides a testbed for work on quantum error correction.
