## EnQlave audit firm x41 D-Sec starts audit

[x41 D-Sec](https://www.x41-dsec.de/) has started their audit of project [enQlave](https://enqlave.io/), an Ethereum webwallet which allows any user to secure their ether or ERC20 token balances from quantum theft.

[x41 D-Sec](https://www.x41-dsec.de/) was one of the two external auditors involved with auditing cryptographic portions of our QRL codebase ([report here](https://github.com/theQRL/audits/blob/master/X41-theQRL-Review-2018-Final-Report.pdf)), so their expertise is fitting for auditing the smart contract code for any possible issues as well. Audits, along with code review and testing coverage, will continue to play a vital role in ensuring the security fundamentals that underpin our codebase. Our previous audits can be found on our [github](https://github.com/theQRL/audits).

The audit has begun and is expected to be completed within the coming weeks.

## Insight Research joins QRL

Insight research has joined QRL and work has already begun!

The primary focus will be towards QRL’s Proof-of-Stake network with research into lattice cryptography and signature aggregation. These key elements will allow us to reduce the overall block-size, allowing for a higher number of validators per epoch, and improve its scalability.

Full release coming.

## Proof-of-Stake Updates

* Transactions: Tested
* OTS Index Validation: Tested
* P2P code nearly complete
* Code for processing and recording the attestation transaction for the proposed block has been finished

## Quantum Computing and Security News

Last month we’ve been witness to massive advances in quantum computing as companies have been on each-others tails improving their quantum volume and decreasing noise bringing us closer to logical qubits.
