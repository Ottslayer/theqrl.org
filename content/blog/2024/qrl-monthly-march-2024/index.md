## Highlights

### Primary Report, 2024

{{< image "./images/h.pr.png" >}}

Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) was established to address the potential threats quantum computing (QC) will pose to blockchain technology, which is presently widely reliant on quantum-vulnerable cryptography.

Amid widespread uncertainty in the expert community regarding the timeline and specific quantum capabilities required to challenge existing cryptographic defenses, QRL aims to provide a preemptive solution. The project, initiated with Dr. Peter Waterlandâ€™s whitepaper in 2016, strives to be a safeguard for the blockchain industry against the evolving quantum threat, positioning itself as a foundational technology for future innovations in the Quantum Age.

## QRL Zond Development

Significant progress on various fronts related to the Qrysm and Go-Zond projects. While the majority of unit and integration tests for Qrysm have been completed, there are still 20 to 30 tests pending. Refinements include refactoring Dilithium public key and signature lengths into the fieldparams package, removing obsolete stream methods, and renaming Qrysm v2 API services to v1. Additionally, the porting of trueblocks.io to support zond compatibility is ongoing, and there is active development on adding more unit tests for Qrysm and initiating tests for Go-Zond.

On the other hand, the team is also focused on enhancing P2P and state initialization code, particularly for Qrysm, with code reviews in progress. For Go-Zond, test development is underway alongside the implementation of offline functionality for the Zond web wallet. Efforts are also being made to introduce advanced sending settings, further demonstrating a comprehensive approach to refining and expanding the capabilities of both Qrysm and Go-Zond in the ecosystem.
