{{< image "./images/day1.png" >}}

Welcome to the first day of the **12 Days of Zond**! We’re kicking off the celebration with an activity that’s as fun as it is brainy: the **Post-Quantum Crossword Puzzle Competition**. 🥨🔐  

### What Is It? 

A fun dozen word crossword puzzle inspired by post-quantum cryptography, quantum computing, and Zond? Test your knowledge, take a sip of your favorite coffee/tea, and compete for a little prize!

### How to Participate  

**1. Take a look at the Crossword Puzzle**

**3. Submit Your Crossword Puzzle** 

Once your crossword puzzle is completed correctly, submit your answers by:  

1. Take a quick screenshot of your completed crossword
2. Gather your screenshot 
     - For a bonus you can share this event on social media as well and include a link to it in your message to us. 
3. Have your QRL address handy (or [Create a QRL address]() if you haven't already!)
4. Reaching out to us on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, or Reddit:
     - Preferred: DM'ing your finished crossword puzzle image to our official QRL Twitter/x handle ([@QRLedger](https://x.com/QRLedger)), 
     - DM'ing @jackalyst on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/356943957588049920)/[Telegram](https://t.me/jackalyst)

>
> This fits our [standard reward distribution](#standard-reward-distribution) where early participants get more QRL than ones that arrive later.

## Guidelines and additional information

### Create QRL Address

Ready to join the QRL community? Here's how to create your own unique QRL address in just a few simple steps: 

1. Download a Wallet: Visit our [downloads](/downloads) page and choose the wallet that suits you best.
2. Create Your Wallet: Follow the instructions within the wallet application to set up your new wallet. 
3. Find Your QRL Address: Once your wallet is created, your QRL address will be displayed. It will always start with a "Q".

**Important Security Tip:**  Always back up your hexseed (a unique string of characters) or mnemonic phrase (a list of words). This ensures you can recover your wallet if something happens to your device. 

> Note: For the mobile wallet, there is a community lead wallet by [Volt Development](https://volt-development.com/) available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volt.qrlmobile) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qrl-mobile/id6448219494) that has been preferable to many.
