## A Look Back

Six years ago, on June 26, 2018, we launched QRL, setting a new standard in blockchain technology. 

Our goal was ambitious: to create the first enterprise-grade, quantum-secure blockchain, leveraging the stateful signature scheme XMSS, a far cry from the ECDSA used in other major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This was not just an innovation — it was a necessary step to stay ahead in a world where quantum computing could pose a serious threat to cryptographic security.

Our journey began with a solid foundation, meticulously built over a rigorous year and a half of testnet trials. This extended period allowed us to identify and address potential issues, ensuring the robustness of our platform. Our commitment to security was further demonstrated by undergoing two comprehensive audits conducted by the esteemed firms [Red4Sec](https://red4sec.com/en) and [x41 D-Sec](https://x41-dsec.de/).

## Growth and Development

Since our launch, QRL has not just sustained but thrived. We've expanded our ecosystem to include:

- Desktop and mobile wallets for a seamless user experience across all major platforms.
- An enhanced API, making it easier for developers to integrate and build on our platform.
- Innovations like the Ephemeral Messaging LatticeTX, offering post-quantum secure communications.
- The introduction of weighted threshold multisignature transactions, adding an extra layer of flexibility and security.

### Quantum computing developments

QRL isn't the only entity making strides. Over the past year, numerous significant advancements and widespread adoption have been showcased across various sectors in the quantum computing space.

[Meta](/quantum-news/2024/post-quantum-readiness-for-tls-at-meta/) and [Apple](/quantum-news/2024/apple-adds-pq3-quantum-resistant-encryption-to-imessage/) have implemented post-quantum cryptographic protocols to enhance security against future quantum threats, while [Zoom](/quantum-news/2024/zoom-adds-post-quantum-end-to-end-encryption-to-video-meetings/) has introduced post-quantum encryption for video meetings. 

[NVIDIA's CUDA-Q platform](/quantum-news/2024/nvidia-accelerates-quantum-computing-centers-worldwide-with-cuda-q-platform/) is now utilized by supercomputing centers globally to integrate quantum processing units. 

Researchers have engineered the purest silicon for [potential million-qubit quantum chips](/quantum-news/2024/worlds-purest-silicon-could-lead-to-1st-million-qubit-quantum-computing-chips/), and [IBM's error correction methods have marked quantum computers' transition into practical utility](/quantum-news/2024/ibm-quantum-computing-blog-landmark-ibm-error-correction-paper-on-nature-cover/). A [large-scale tweezer array demonstrated trapping over 6,100 atoms](/quantum-news/2024/a-tweezer-array-with-6100-highly-coherent-atomic-qubits/), signaling potential for universal quantum computing. 

Additionally, a Boston-based firm, [QuEra, plans to launch a 10,000-qubit quantum computer by 2026](/quantum-news/2024/us-firm-plans-to-build-10-000-qubit-quantum-computer-by-2026/), and [Taiwan connected its first home-grown quantum computer to the internet](/quantum-news/2024/us-firm-plans-to-build-10-000-qubit-quantum-computer-by-2026/), aiding global research efforts. 

These milestones highlight rapid progress and the growing impact of quantum technology.

## Looking Ahead

As we celebrate our 6 year milestone, we reflect on our journey so far and anticipate the advancements the coming year will bring. 

The next generation of QRL, codenamed Zond, is introducing key features such as web3 compatibility and a proof-of-stake protocol with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract support. QRL Zond integrates post-quantum secure methods with Ethereum architecture, offering a secure platform for future applications in decentralized finance (DeFi).

This has been years in the making and we're happy to be, in beta-testnet which has been running uninterrupted and as reliably as our current post-quantum secure mainnet network!

Development is in full swing, and we eagerly anticipate sharing our upcoming milestones as we bring the next generation of QRL to fruition.

## Thank you

To everyone who has been a part of this journey, from our earliest supporters to our newest members, thank you. Your belief in our vision fuels our continued innovation and commitment.

Here’s to many more years of leading the way in quantum-secure blockchain technology!
