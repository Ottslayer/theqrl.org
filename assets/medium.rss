            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Month at QRL — August 2020</h3><h4>EnQlave audit firm selected: x41 D-Sec, QRL AMA 4 part series complete, QRL Quick Qlips Contest, New Korean Social Media Ambassador, Proof-of-Stake devnet approaches: updates, new QRL pool integration, and quantum news updates.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jGQaWd9oszSsI4Zmlz_Ucg.png" /></figure><h3>EnQlave audit firm selected: x41 D-Sec</h3><p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">x41 D-Sec</a> has been contracted to audit project <a href="https://enqlave.io/">enQlave</a>, an Ethereum webwallet which allows any user to secure their ether or ERC20 token balances from quantum theft.</p><p><a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">x41 D-Sec</a> was one of the two external auditors involved with auditing cryptographic portions of our QRL codebase (<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/audits/blob/master/X41-theQRL-Review-2018-Final-Report.pdf">report here</a>), so their expertise is fitting for auditing the smart contract code for any possible issues as well. Audits, along with code review and testing coverage, will continue to play a vital role in ensuring the security fundamentals that underpin our codebase.</p><p>The audit will start in the coming months and is expected to last a few weeks, though more details will emerge when they start.</p><h3>Proof-of-Stake: Devnet Approaches, update</h3><p>We are weeks away from a devnet (I know we’ve been saying that), which after some testing by the QRL team, will result in a public testnet! If you haven’t already, our lead core developer, Kaushal Kumar Singh, did an AMA special about PoS, which can be found on youtube in our latest video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1Mp71D2xF0">“QRL Ask Me Anything #4 with QRL Lead Developer Kaushal Singh — E12”</a></p><h4>Progress over the last month</h4><ol><li>State management has been finished, which supports multiple forks at a time, and allows switching from one fork to another quickly.</li><li>Consensus protocol, such as allotment of block proposer (a.k.a slot leader) and attestors for each slot number has been done.</li><li>Currently we have a fixed reward for both block proposer and attestor. The algorithm for reward will change after the successful test of devnet</li><li>Basic Wallet CLI that allows generating wallet, genesis block, Dilithium keys, stake transactions.</li><li>We have four transactions, namely — Transfer Transaction, Stake Transaction, Attest Transaction &amp; CoinBase Transaction.</li><li>Message, Slave Transaction and Transfer Transaction has been merged together as a single Transaction known as Transfer Transaction.</li><li>Network ID has been added into all transactions. This helps to differentiate a transaction signed for a different network. So devnet, mainnet, testnet all will have a different network id. In case any transaction is received by a different network, it will be rejected.</li><li>Dilithium cryptography support has been added which allows you to stake on the network.</li><li>Fields such as block header hash has been removed from Block and transaction hash has been removed from Transaction. These fields are no more stored into the message itself, as it can itself be derived from the other data fields provided in the transaction hash.</li><li>Currently the P2P is in progress</li></ol><h3>QRL AMA 4 part series complete</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QsglEv4uZXFDq7X12W4Wog.png" /></figure><h4>Part 1</h4><p>Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVabWOop-iQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVabWOop-iQ</a></p><p><strong>Topics covered</strong></p><ul><li>What is QRL?</li><li>How did the QRL get started?</li><li>Minimum staking requirements for Proof-of-Stake</li><li>Ethereum 2.0 and sharding</li><li>Verifiable Delay Funcations and random Consensus</li></ul><h4>Part 2</h4><p>Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ9RUcNArp4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ9RUcNArp4</a></p><p><strong>Topics covered</strong></p><ul><li>Proof-of-Stake protocol changes</li><li>OCAML smart-contracts</li><li>Project enQlave</li><li>Ephemeral messaging, and</li><li>Move to golang with GO-QRL</li></ul><h4>Part 3</h4><p>Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2xRuOa3Nos">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2xRuOa3Nos</a></p><p><strong>Topics covered</strong></p><ul><li>When will the financial report come out?</li><li>How long can QRL continue to develop with existing funds?</li><li>Exchanges, what is the barrier of entry?</li><li>Did the foundation get a legal opinion if QRL can be considered a security?</li><li>The QRL team is so small, how has it achieved so much with comparatively fewer resources?</li><li>How will QRL deal with the potential claims for migrating unmigrated tokens?</li></ul><h4>Part 4</h4><p>Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1Mp71D2xF0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1Mp71D2xF0</a></p><p><strong>Topics covered</strong></p><ul><li>100% PoS or Hybrid (ie.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Month at QRL — July 2020</h3><h4>NIST enters final ‘Selection Round’, Proof-of-Stake devnet getting closer, QRL AMA part 1 and 2 released, new Chinese social media ambassador, and QRL Fun with memes contest results!</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kgT-W8uiU9OpQMCbRkSdQg.png" /></figure><p><a href="https://theqrl.org">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> are pioneers in the field, addressing the threat quantum computers pose to blockchain.</p><p>To this day, it’s the <em>only</em> blockchain that utilizes a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2019/draft-sp-800-208-stateful-hash-based-sig-schemes">signature scheme that’s recognised</a> by the United States <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST)</a> as being post-quantum secure with its use of <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2019/draft-sp-800-208-stateful-hash-based-sig-schemes">XMSS</a>.</p><p>Beyond just having a quantum secure foundation to build off of, we wanted to make sure we were able to seamlessly and <em>safely</em> adapt to other post-quantum signature schemes with an <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/developers/address/">extensible address format</a>, should future signature schemes offer beneficial attributes (faster, smaller, etc). This is important to note best <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/07/nists-post-quantum-cryptography-program-enters-selection-round">NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography Program Entered a final ‘Selection Round’</a>. <strong>Should we see something from this final selection round, we’ll be able to implement the new signature scheme as an option.</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZUqzuXkczaSYqL9vNs6AFA.png" /><figcaption>Credit: B.

First iteration will be <em>devnet</em>, which can be thought of as a precursor to testnet where the core team members and developers are used as the first round of guinea pigs.</p><p>This often involves trying to poke holes in the system, but also gives some time to create documentation around the system — as devnet doesn’t often come with detailed documentation handy!</p><p>Assuming it all goes well, devnet will progress to <em>testnet</em>, which is more wildly distributed and includes documentation so you’re not flying blind.</p><h4>QRL Wallet Message transactions</h4><p>The QRL wallet now has the ability to add a message with your transaction! This can be used for everything from inspirational notes to recording other pertinent information such as invoice ID’s.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/615/1*u_Gj1WrRmMS0CQoOvRA5uQ.gif" /></figure><p>For example, we used the message field to both offer congratulations and as a way to remember why we performed the transaction, should we look on this a few years from now while scratching our heads.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/849/1*COpH4DvXTRR0P9cAfVrYUg.png" /></figure><h3>Community &amp; advocacy</h3><h4>QRL Ask Me Anything (AMA) — parts 1 and 2 released</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BBftkXBezEYGdbReoocHDw.png" /></figure><p>After reviewing the questions and recording the AMA, the amount of content that came out was much more than expected and so we have broken the AMA into a 4 part series.

commence around August, and upon completion of that research, integration should be quick.</li><li><strong>Ephemeral Messaging System (EMS)</strong><br>Deferred from genesis due to python not having suitable threading to meet the stability requirements of releasing a stable open-source enterprise-grade post-quantum blockchain. <br><em>Since then</em>, we’ve had an Ephemeral Messaging System (EMS) stub and tooling created, allowing anyone to create their own post-quantum secure messaging service, today — though using their own network. <br>The decentralized node based network is still slated, and depends on GO-QRL.</li><li><strong>Decentralized on-chain poll support</strong><br>Deferred for more testing and to further ensure that we cover a wide breadth of governance

of the almost 100 million <a href="https://medium.com/u/d626b3859bc9">ethereum</a> unique addresses representing 31 billion in value in ETH alone post-quantum security, enQlave has the possibility to bring post-quantum security to the users of platforms such as <a href="https://medium.com/u/948dd45fd3d0">Tezos</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/628454c4bc31">eosio</a> with enough interest and sufficiently expressive smart-contract capabilities.</p><h4>Progress continues: Smart contract audit not far behind</h4><p>Right now there’s a working interface which allows you to sign transactions, add and replace any number of keys, and create Ethereum Quantum Resistant Tokens (eQRT).</p><p>The smart contract is just going through some final touches and is getting closer to a final review, which will be followed with an audit.</p><h3>QRL v2.0.5 release</h3><p>Release can be <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/releases/tag/v2.0.5">found on github</a> — it’s not a required update but it does give some special functionality!</p><h4>Google annotations for REST support for PublicAPI &amp; added google-api-python-client</h4><p>This will give anyone immediate URL address resolution to QRL’s PublicAPI without having to install, run and maintain separate server components.</p><p>Previously, by default, you’d have access to just the QRL node API, which is fine when you’re interfacing through terminal, but isn’t helpful when creating applications as it’s not as expressive and encourages the use of your languages exec functions, something that, depending on the language, can be more difficult to keep safe.</p><p>Soon you’ll be able to use a REST API to return useful information. If, <em>for example</em>, you install the node through pip3 and utilize envoy-proxy, to return the blockheight, the address would be <a href="https://127.0.0.1/state">https://127.0.0.1:7778/api/height</a></p><p>If you installed docker, this would be similar, but you’d need to get the IP address of your container.</p><h4>Other updates</h4><ul><li>Updated setuptools version to 46.4.0 &amp; protobuf to 3.6.0</li></ul><h3>qrl-cli updates</h3><p>The QRL-CLI has gone from v1.4.5 → 1.7.1 and added refinements, especially to our Ephemeral Messaging System (EMS) system.</p><h3>Secure Smart Addresses language foundation chosen: OCAML</h3><p>Hidden within the <a href="https://www.enqlave.io">enQlave announcement(s)</a> is that we’ve been working on bringing <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCAML</a> smart contracts to the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) platform for the next hardfork, Cesium.</p><p>From <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCAML</a>’s overview:</p><blockquote>[OCAML] is used in environments where <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html">a single mistake can cost millions and speed matters</a>. … It’s a safe language. Programs are verified by the compiler before they can be executed, which rules out many programming errors, such as, for instance, confusing an integer for a pointer, or accessing a nonexistent field in a record.</blockquote><h3>QIP012: Suggestion for transaction replay protection</h3><p><strong>Whilst currently an extremely low risk vulnerability</strong>, replay attack protection should ideally be considered and implemented in the next hard fork to completely mitigate this attack vector.</p><p>The attack scenario involves a transaction from one blockchain network being relayed to another through a malicious node. This is something possible between QRL Testnet and QRL Mainnet, however, it is not recommended to use the same QRL XMSS account on both testnet and mainnet due to the potential risk of OTS re-use.</p><p>Where this becomes more pertinent is when there’s an increase of multiple existing chains persisting where people are more likely to either confuse what chain they’re on, or be inclined to switch between chains and reuse accounts. The chance of such a scenario happening will increase as more interest is accumulated and with certain forking events, such as the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.</p><p>Some proposed solutions in the QIP are:</p><p><strong>network ID</strong> — A unique numerical identifier, nodes on each network would find any transaction not using the correct identifier invalid. An example would be &#39;0000&#39; = devnet, &#39;0001&#39; = testnet, &#39;0002&#39; = mainnet, &#39;0003&#39; = mainnet pos, or simply stamping the genesis block hash into each transaction. Note this does not prevent replay attacks in later forks of a network using the same identifier.</p><p><strong>block hash</strong> — each block in the chain has a unique hash value obtained from aggregating and hashing the block header (and incorporating the previous block header hash). Thus, stamping each transaction with the a recent 32 byte block header hash is a simple way of preventing a replay attack. The significant downside is this requires the transaction signer to know something about the current QRL chain which could be a problem for offline transaction signing. Another consideration is that choosing the most recent block could lead to a transaction entering the mempool only for the block to be discarded in a mini-fork and then the transaction become invalid. It would make sense then to choose a block hash at a given depth from the tip of the chain or specific epoch blocks at 1k intervals (or something suitable).</p><p><strong>tx hash</strong> — it is possible for each transaction to optionally include the txhash of the last transaction from the account. It would therefore force an attacker to replay all historical transactions since the fork to achieve success — if there are no transactions since the fork then this would not be effective at preventing a replay attack.</p><p>While this subject has been previously discussed at length by the core development team, we would like to thank <a href="https://red4sec.com/en">red4sec</a> (who <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/red4sec-security-audit-concludes-a-summary-563ecfe04c75">performed one of our audits</a>) for reminding us.</p><p>QIP012&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/25/files?short_path=6fdf8c6#diff-6fdf8c6fc91383d3892ca9efd19a6cd9">overview</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/25">discussion</a> can be found on github.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ae03c3d34a78" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-month-at-qrl-may-2020-ae03c3d34a78">Last month at QRL — May 2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The QRL enQlave Project — Bringing Post-Quantum Security to Ethereum</h3><h4>QRL’s Smart Contracts will bring the post-quantum security of XMSS (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391">eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme</a>) to mainnet Ethereum, and eventually to any other blockchain platform with sufficiently expressive smart contract capabilities.</h4><p><strong>tl;dr </strong>The QRL enQlave Project will:</p><ul><li>Enable Ethereum users to protect their ETH and ERC-20 balances from the risk of a quantum computer attack, using Smart Contracts on mainnet Ethereum.</li><li>Enable the bi-directional migration of Quanta (QRL’s token) between QRL ←→ Ethereum and eventually any blockchain network with sufficient smart contract capabilities.</li><li>Enable the creation of post-quantum secure tokens on mainnet Ethereum (Ethereum Quantum Resistant Tokens, or “eQRTs”).</li></ul><p>Where possible, the QRL team has built off of <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin">OpenZeppelin primitives</a> in order to make trust / audits easier. <strong><em>It should be noted that the transaction costs for these functions are currently very high.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Slightly more involved tl;dr:</strong></p><p>There will be one “XMSS Registry” Contract which keeps a mapping (think: a phone book) of Ethereum addresses ←→ XMSS public keys. This contract will deploy a unique instance of a PQ-secure multi-signature wallet for any individual caller who provides an XMSS public key. The XMSS key will serve as an additional layer of protection for any funds stored in the PQ-secure multi-signature wallet, and once deposited, funds will only be able to be moved by a valid transaction from the associated Ethereum address + a valid XMSS signature (verified by the “XMSS Registry” contract) on the details of the desired transaction.</p><p>In addition to this protection functionality, the main “XMSS Registry” contract will also be able to deploy “eQRTs” (Ethereum Quantum Resistant Tokens). These tokens provide all the functionality in the ERC-20 specification, but can only be sent between users with associated XMSS public keys (upon successful XMSS signature verification).</p><p><em>It should be noted that the transaction costs for these functions are very high,</em><strong><em> </em></strong>although we are working to optimize the contracts and otherwise bring the gas cost down. At this stage, it makes sense primarily to secure ETH and ERC-20s from the risk of a quantum-computer attack when the funds do not need to be moved frequently. An XMSS signature verification could cost upwards of 5M gas (anywhere from $2-$16, depending on network congestion and desired speed, at current ETH/average gwei rates), making frequent outbound transactions from a PQ-secure multi-sig wallet expensive. The QRL Foundation will pursue a third-party audit of our code before deploying it to the main network.</p><blockquote>The QRL Foundation foresees a world where global and digital economies rely on blockchain networks, and believes that before digital securities can be issued — or before ownership of assets can be widely tokenized in general — organizations and individuals will need to be certain that their digital assets cannot be compromised by a sudden advance in quantum-computing technology. Today, that guarantee is only available on the QRL main network, which has been operational, secure, and third-party audited since the summer of 2018.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xszcNzQ6zibFBxQ3" /><figcaption>An early design diagram of the enQlave system</figcaption></figure><p>A primary design requirement was to keep track of XMSS public keys and signatures — one quirk of XMSS (and the main aspect which prevents it from being a silver-bullet replacement for today’s internet public-key security infrastructure) is its “stateful” nature. An XMSS public key actually represents a “tree” of One-Time Signature (OTS) keys, meaning that a user’s security could be compromised if they were to sign two different messages with the same OTS key. In ECDSA and other common digital signature algorithms, there is no notion of “multiple” keys (aside from public-private), and you can not “run out” of signatures.</p><p><strong><em>XMSSAccount Management:</em></strong></p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/b6509ce77c71a4dc99735d579ed28012/href">https://medium.com/media/b6509ce77c71a4dc99735d579ed28012/href</a></iframe><p>The implication of XMSS’s stateful nature for the QRL enQlave project is that the OTS index (the next free One-time Signature to be used) is a crucial value for each XMSS public key, which must be strictly tracked and maintained. In our contracts, if you use up an OTS but the transaction otherwise fails (if the value argument supplied was greater than the balance of your PQ-secure multisig, for example), you have still used up one OTS key.</p><p>As a result of being able to “run out” of signatures, there exists a need to be able to “replace” an XMSS public key which has run out of One-Time Signatures. We have designed our contracts so that a user can only use their last OTS in order to replace their current XMSS public key, thus providing a guarantee that nobody can be “locked out” and that there is a way for users to replenish their supply of One-Time Signatures to make transactions with. The default tree-height of an XMSS public key generated using QRL’s interface allows for 1024 such OTS / transactions.</p><p><strong><em>Functions for “Typical” and “Power” users:</em></strong></p><p>Another design decision was to accommodate a wide range of potential users. While recognizing that most users will be well-served by a single XMSS public key (with a default of 1024 OTS), we wanted to design our contracts to be future-proof in every way possible. As a result, we have included functionality for “power users” — potential future users (exchanges, businesses deploying security tokens, etc) who might want to have more than one XMSS public key associated with their Ethereum address, or those who might want to make an XMSSAccount without deploying the PQ-Secure multisig (those who only want to use eQRT functionality, for example, where the token never “leaves” the eQRT contract to be “stored” in another Ethereum address).</p><p>This flexibility was accomplished by using Solidity’s function overloading capabilities. For every user-facing function, there are two versions — one for the typical user, and one for the power user (where additional relevant arguments can be passed in). As is standard programming practice, each of these duplicate functions in turn calls the same internal function with separate parameters to eliminate code duplication.</p><p><strong><em>eQRTs:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*8SSMzQAuLTJTRcvv" /><figcaption>Inside the constructor of the “Registry” Contract, an eQRTFactory is deployed</figcaption></figure><p>All generated eQRTs (deployed by a linked “eQRTFactory”) refer back to the main XMSS registry account for XMSS signature verification.</p><p>The deployers of eQRTs will be able to (optionally) leverage the advantages of GSN (the “Gas Station Network”), which allows for “meta-transactions”. In other words, someone will be able to interact with the eQRT contract from an ethereum address with 0 ETH (not enough to cover even small transaction fees), because the eQRT contract will be able to pay for such transactions (according to the deployer’s arbitrary criteria / GSN “strategy”). This was included for future-proofing purposes, because it significantly eases the onboarding process of certain applications.</p><p><strong><em>OpenZeppelin:</em></strong></p><p>Where possible, we have used primitives and building blocks provided by OpenZeppelin. An example is our ERC-20 code — we use the already-audited implementation provided by OpenZeppelin, with the only modification being a requirement for a valid XMSS signature before processing certain transactions.</p><p>It is our hope that this will make auditing our code easier. We would like to thank OpenZeppelin for the extremely valuable open-source infrastructure they have built.</p><p><strong><em>Moving Forward:</em></strong></p><p>As a part of making this tool accessible to members of the QRL and Ethereum communities, we are developing a web-interface and will work towards integration with the Nano Ledger family of devices (a feature many users of both QRL and Ethereum are accustomed to).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/769/1*D_kDQt8eZSMue5WjC3IrLQ.gif" /><figcaption>An alpha-stage version of the front-end in action</figcaption></figure><p>QRL’s primary focus is security, and we will uphold the same technical rigor that has gone into the other parts of our ecosystem (the cryptography and blockchain implementations, respectively) to this venture. We will obtain and release a third-party audit before deploying our contracts to the Ethereum mainnet. We hope that this tool can provide value for Ethereum users and bring wider awareness to the pioneering work of the QRL project in the realm of digital asset security.</p><p><strong>An introduction to the author:</strong></p><p>I am a core QRL dev who joined the team in 12/2019 and am very excited for the future of QRL and Ethereum. If you have any questions about these Smart Contracts, or the system as a whole, feel free to tag me at @dr_gonzo in the QRL discord.</p><p><em>A final note: a significant portion of the heavy-lifting on this project — the EVM-assembly-optimized XMSS Signature verification code — was performed by longtime QRL developer Kaushal Singh (Ed — is he human or machine?).</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=31df477c543" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/the-qrl-enklave-project-bringing-post-quantum-security-to-ethereum-and-other-blockchain-platforms-31df477c543">The QRL Enqlave Project — Bringing Post-Quantum Security to Ethereum and other blockchain platforms</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And quantum risk grows with higher crypto asset valuations looming and QC development beginning to bear fruit.</p><p>Whilst our development team works to integrate OCAML smart contracts into our next fork — very exciting as this introduces amazing functionality — we have been working on a tangential move since the end of 2019 to bring the QRL to a much wider audience and raise the profile of the project considerably with a new wallet called <strong>enQlave </strong>.</p><h3>What is it?</h3><p>EnQlave wallet is an Ethereum Webwallet which allows any user to secure their ether or erc20 token balances from quantum theft.</p><p>It also brings the very first post-quantum secure token to Ethereum — which of course is the QRL.</p><h3>Why Ethereum?</h3><p>Ethereum is the first platform we have chosen for enQlave to natively support. The reason for this is largely down to the maturity of the EVM, the size of the existing userbase, and the combined market cap of Ethereum and erc20-based projects (currently 45 of the top 100 on CMC).</p><p>In our first iteration we will be able to offer post-quantum security to a very significant unprotected percentage of the entire crypto asset space. If we gain traction we will add support to other promising smaller smart contract platforms such as Tezos, EOS, Stellar etc.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>Through a simple UI and compatible with the ledger hardware wallet, enQlave is a non-custodial hybrid post-quantum secure multi-sig Ethereum wallet (quite a mouthful).</p><p>Behind the scenes, each wallet instance creates a smart contract on Ethereum and generates a unique post-quantum secure contract address. This is your enQlave wallet address and with it you may receive ether or erc20 tokens like any normal Ethereum address.</p><p>The magic begins when you move funds out of the wallet.</p><p>A normal address requires you to simply sign a transaction with your ethereum private key to move funds— something done under the hood by your wallet software or hardware wallet.</p><p>Moving funds out of your post-quantum secure contract address requires both a standard Ethereum ECDSA signature but also an XMSS signature from an XMSS public key linked during the setup phase.</p><p>The enQlave wallet signs each outbound transaction with both ECDSA and XMSS — potentially from one or more hardware wallets depending upon your security paranoia level.</p><p>Without both valid signatures no funds can leave your enQlave address and so the enQlave wallet is ultra cold storage — <strong><em>removing the future risk of quantum threat for the first time in an address you can re-use at will</em></strong>.</p><h3>Wait did you say XMSS on ethereum?</h3><p>Using assembly optimisation we have managed to code functional XMSS signature verification on ethereum. To squish the computation down as much as possible we have stretched the signature size compared with the QRL mainnet.</p><p>It has a gas heavy per transaction cost but for an ultra cold storage solution potentially securing billions of dollars of crypto assets we do not see this as a problem.</p><h3>QRL back on ethereum?</h3><p>With the ability to verify XMSS signatures on ethereum comes the need to track XMSS tree state. To do this we have designed and built an XMSS registry smart contract on ethereum which allows the potential for XMSS powered tokens to run natively on ethereum.</p><p>The first and only planned such post-quantum secure token is QRL. We will be adding an easy way to hop your QRL between the native QRL webwallet and an enQlave ethereum wallet address (or visa versa) and a blog post detailing the mechanics of this bridge is coming in the near future.</p><h3>Can I see the prototype?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Sf9TQYn9L3v2si9DZvePJg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*95Afxvvut7wI35JDEJZjGQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/555/1*U-_9qQ2AwSllFc9Qos8pzg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/559/1*tBPjjFOtbN8LPYnYr0pjBg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VbV7E47ki_rvjpDk0c8XSw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/527/1*LHADqouPalb7gSHLT3RB-w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/511/1*x4KhWKtk77zovV7l9jLo0w.png" /><figcaption>Unskinned prototype front end</figcaption></figure><p>Here are some screenshots from the latest build which is currently running on a private Ethereum network. Remember this is as yet unskinned and the final appearance will change considerably as we move towards production, beautify things and simplify the UI.</p><h3>What is left before this reaches production?</h3><p>A smart contract audit, some ledger integration and lots of testing before we move to Ethereum mainnet.</p><h3>Can I take a deep dive into how this works?</h3><p>As always our code will be open source and our repo will soon be going public on github in our theqrl repo.</p><p>A video detailing the backend mechanics can be seen <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420287807">here</a>.

This guide is going to take you through installing the Windows Agent, but if you’re setting up multiple rigs, you’ll want to get mmpOS.</p><p>After downloading, extract the contents of the zip folder and click on ‘agent’. This agent will be listening for commands we give it later in this guide. Leave it open.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YeEulCVJbQoj9vg7vZS_GA.png" /></figure><h4>Step 3: Create a QRL Wallet and get its Address</h4><p>You can follow our documentation guide, but it should be straightforward to go to <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">https://wallet.theqrl.org</a> and create a wallet there.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DGs0f3mOth1delc6bgvN5w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y9EmSa0e4B7kmV-ZKqiNaQ.png" /></figure><h4>Step 4: Add wallet address to mmpOS</h4><p>Click on wallets in the sidebar of the mmpOS web interface or go to <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/wallets/">https://app.mmpos.eu/wallets</a> to add a wallet. Make sure you select “Quantum Resistant Ledger”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VK82Wqn10Ml7_pwoWNTWYw.png" /></figure><h4>Step 5: Add a pool</h4><p>Click on pools in the sidebar of the web mmpOS interface or go to <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/pools/">https://app.mmpos.eu/pools/</a> to and click Add Pool in the top right hand corner.</p><p>You can find pool information in our documentation at <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/pools/">https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/pools/</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EXY67Kx-cO8TUIh2Kk0UDQ.png" /></figure><h4>Step 6: Add a miner profile</h4><p>A miner profile combines a miner with a pool selected. Because your miner is going to be on Windows and we’re mining with randomx, change the platform to <em>Windows </em>and Miner to <em>xmrig randomx</em>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E6WIAATXpxJJWVyGGowyGQ.png" /></figure><h4>Step 7: Add a mining rig</h4><p>If you haven’t already, launch the agent from the extracted folder in Step 2</p><p>Then go to rigs in the sidebar of the web mmpOS interface or visit <a href="https://app.mmpos.eu/rigs">https://app.mmpos.eu/rigs</a> and click on <em>Add rig</em>.</p><p>Because the agent is on the same system, you should be able to automatically register it by clicking on “Automatically register”. When you do so, you should see activity in your agent console window.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4QUkx67BSSYL24SvId8MKg.png" /></figure><h4>Step 8: Configure the miner rig</h4><p>Click on your mining rig name and make sure everything is setup correctly. If no mining profile is selected, select the one you made earlier.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*91TrViuJSL7BUcs5mRzv5w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E0j6PBsdHE69QeIGawQniw.png" /></figure><h4>Step 9: That should be it!</h4><p>The agent will download the selected miner and start mining. After a few minutes, you’ll start to see charts display.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Qzz5oXKQ82eX1j-pdApCWw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uIXaPU6mbK7iSAh-N29FaA.png" /></figure><h4>Step 10: Stuck? Get help</h4><p>mmpOS has a <a href="https://discord.gg/P5J6Z5h">discord </a>and <a href="https://t.me/mmpos_intl">telegram</a> with people that are always willing to help.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dc28d8e6693e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/new-mining-platform-integration-and-guide-mine-qrl-on-mmp-os-dc28d8e6693e">New mining platform integration and guide: Mine QRL on MMP OS</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
