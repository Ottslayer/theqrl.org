Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) was established to address the potential threats quantum computing (QC) will pose to blockchain technology, which is presently widely reliant on quantum-vulnerable cryptography. 

Amid widespread uncertainty in the expert community regarding the timeline and specific quantum capabilities required to challenge existing cryptographic defenses, QRL aims to provide a preemptive solution. The project, initiated with Dr. Peter Waterland's whitepaper in 2016, strives to be a safeguard for the blockchain industry against the evolving quantum threat, positioning itself as a foundational technology for future innovations in the Quantum Age.
