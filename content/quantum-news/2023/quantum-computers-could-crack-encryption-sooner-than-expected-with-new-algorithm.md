blurb: |
  One of the most well-established and disruptive uses for a future quantum computer is the ability to crack encryption. A new algorithm could significantly lower the barrier to achieving this.

  The saving grace has been that today's quantum processors are a long way from the kind of scale required. But according to a report in Science, New York University computer scientist Oded Regev has discovered a new algorithm that could reduce the number of qubits required substantially.

  In Shor's original algorithm, the number of gates required to factor a number is the square of the number of bits used to represent it, which is denoted as n^2. Regev's approach would only require n^1.5
