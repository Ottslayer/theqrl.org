blurb: "Quantum information traveled across a quantum system in what could be understood
  as traversing a wormhole. A wormhole is a bridge between two remote spacetime regions.
  This experiment performed on the Sycamore quantum processor device at Google opens
  the doors to future experiments with quantum computers. The Sycamore 53-qubit quantum

Quantum information traveled across a quantum system in what could be understood as traversing a wormhole. A wormhole is a bridge between two remote spacetime regions. This experiment performed on the Sycamore quantum processor device at Google opens the doors to future experiments with quantum computers. The Sycamore 53-qubit quantum processor allows researchers to send signals "through the wormhole". 

This opens up the possibility of future quantum gravity experiments with larger quantum computers. The work is supported by a Department of Energy Office of High Energy Physics QuantISED program grant.
