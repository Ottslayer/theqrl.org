*News and notes from QRL*

## Introduction

Spring is upon us in many parts of the northern hemisphere as we enter the second week of April. Much like the changes in the natural world, some of the upcoming updates and evolution at QRL are already visible, some are just around the corner, and some are still further off towards the horizon. We will continue to keep you updated with blogs like this one, so tune in each week to see what has been going on (that we can talk about) at QRL.

As mentioned in a [previous “Last Week in QRL” blog](/blog/last-week-in-qrl-march-12-18-2019) — we have and will continue to be updating the website. Some changes have been made internally and are merely waiting to be pushed to the website, while others are still being worked on.

One such change is pictured above. We will be expanding the “Getting Started” section of the website to include a drop-down menu with a variety of links to various resources for a new user. Whatever someone is interested in doing with the network or coin, they can find their path(s) here.

As with all changes to the user experience, feedback is appreciated. We have already seen some very useful and constructive feedback to some of the changes we have pushed to the website, and we are very thankful for it. One of the strengths of our community has always been the passion present within it, and constructive feedback is a wonderful manifestation of this passion.

One such area where we received feedback was our team of core contributors. We had removed the specific section highlighting them, in favor of a more holistic list of our top open source contributors on GitHub. The top contributors list still features all of the core contributors, though it does not highlight them. We received feedback from numerous sources that the more expanded list of contributors was good, while also receiving feedback that the loss of the highlighted core contributors list left things unclear. As a result of that feedback, we have reinstated the [team of core contributors](https://theqrl.org/team/) page.

We hope you continue to send in your feedback, as we continue to push updates live to the website moving forward. As always, we are happy to receive feedback on out [GitHub](https://github.com/theQRL), [Discord](/discord), or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/QRL/).
