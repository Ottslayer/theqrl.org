## Development updates

### EnQlave a Priority

More resources have shifted to enQlave, which after an initial audit, has been updated to decrease the initial GAS cost (was \~20x of a normal transaction). Another audit will be prudent after further development and optimisations are completed.

Beyond demonstrating that we're serious about digital asset security and opening us up to the entire Ethereum community, enQlave paves the way for EQRT's, which allows QRL to be traded on DEX's like Uniswap for increased liquidity options.

Read our recent [update on enQlave](/blog/an-update-on-enqlave/) for more information.

### QRL Wallet 1.7.0 released

A lot has been reworked under the hood to improve **Ledger Nano S/X** support for a more enjoyable and smooth experience for those using hardware wallets. Using our desktop wallet (vs the web wallet) is still recommended at this time.

The latest can be found on the [downloads section of our site](https://theqrl.org/downloads/), while the source along with releases can be found on our GitHub at 
[https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/](https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet)

Additionally, all infrastructure affecting announcements can be found on our status page at [status.theqrl.org](https://status.theqrl.org), be sure to subscribe to those updates.
