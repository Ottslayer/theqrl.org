Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) is collaborating with IBM to develop a cutting-edge quantum computer boasting 10,000 qubits. This ambitious project aims to vastly outperform current quantum computers, which typically operate with only a few hundred qubits.

Additionally, AIST has announced an agreement for the installation of a Fujitsu quantum computer, further solidifying its commitment to advancing quantum computing technology. These initiatives reflect Japan's strategic efforts to lead in the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing.
