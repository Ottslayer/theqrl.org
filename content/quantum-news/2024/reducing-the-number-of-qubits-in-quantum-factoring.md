title: Reducing the Number of Qubits in Quantum Factoring
org: iacr.org
date: "2024-02-13"
blurb: |
  The paper presents an optimization for reducing the number of qubits required in quantum factoring, specifically targeting Shor's algorithm. By employing a combination of techniques, including May and Schlieper's truncation and the Eker책-H책stad variant, the authors achieve a significant reduction in qubit requirement to factor an RSA-2048 instance, potentially using less than 1700 qubits
