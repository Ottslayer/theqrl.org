  event: A visionary blockchain with digital asset security as a core value
  blurb: |
    After being built from the ground up with post-quantum security at its foundation, the QRL went through *two years of testing* and [multiple external audits](https://github.com/theQRL/audits/) before the release of mainnet on **June 26th, 2018**, which has run without interruption ever since.

  event: Crypto-agility with an extensible address format
  blurb: |
    The introduction and solidification of variable key heights and signature space allows QRL to ensure future compatibility with almost anything. Our blockchain includes the 
    possibility to upgrade signature schemes (XMSS, SPHINCS, Falcon, + future) and through an address format update, support different cryptographic hash functions (SHA2_256, SHAKE_128, SHAKE256 etc).
