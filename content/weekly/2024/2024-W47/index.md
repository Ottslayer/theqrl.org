##  Downtime Required for Bitcoin Quantum-Safety | QRL Post-Quantum Panel - Episode #2 

In last weeks QRL Post-Quantum Panel episode on The QRL Show, we were joined by the co-authors of the new paper, "[Downtime Required for Bitcoin Quantum-Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16965)".

The team behind it are experts in the field and have worked together on their latest paper from the School of Computing at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England.

In this panel episode, we cover:

What threat(s) does quantum computing pose to Bitcoin
How they arrived at the numbers in their paper
Which scenario do they see as most likely to play out (can Bitcoin hard fork?)
Technical costs of implementing these safeguards in blockchains
... and much more
