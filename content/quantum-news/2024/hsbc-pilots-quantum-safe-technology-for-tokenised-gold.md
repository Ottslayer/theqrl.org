HSBC has announced a successful trial of quantum-secure technology for trading tokenized physical gold, marking a significant advancement in protecting digital assets against future quantum computing threats. 

Previously, HSBC was the first global bank to offer tokenized physical gold to institutional investors using distributed ledger technology (DLT), and it has since expanded this offering to retail investors in Hong Kong through the HSBC Orion platform. The recent trial included testing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure the secure transfer of digital assets across distributed ledgers, enhancing interoperability by converting HSBC's gold tokens into ERC-20 fungible tokens.
