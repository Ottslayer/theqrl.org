The QRL Foundation continues to seek out researchers as part of its pioneering work in the development of post-quantum cryptographic applications and standards.

We have active crypto-research projects underway in:

- Quantum Resistant Proof-of-Stake
- Lattice-based ZK systems
- ZK-Starks

While there are no current open grants at present, we recommend researchers in this field reach out to the Core Team at [hello@qrl.foundation](mailto:hello@qrl.foundation) if they have a research proposal aligned with the project's activities.
