## Introduction

We’re excited to announce our upcoming [QRL Games - Winter Hackathon 2022](/events/qrl-games-winter-hackathon-2022/). This builds off of the success of our [QRL Hackathon 2022](/events/qrl-hackathon-2022) in Amsterdam where we revealed our public devnet with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and EVM-compatible smart contract functionality. 

The main theme for this hackathon is, as the name implies, all about games. Whether it’s taking inspiration from a nostalgic game you played growing up or gamifying any aspect of the project that your quantum-resistant heart desires, the options here are endless. Just like all of our hackathons, they're open to everyone from professionals, to amateurs. This is a time to join together and earn some Quanta (QRL) along the way!

The main [QRL Games - Winter Hackathon 2022](/events/qrl-games-winter-hackathon-2022/) even will kick off shortly on **Wednesday December 14th** and run until just past the New Year on **Wednesday January 4th, 2023**.


## The Hackathon 

### Overview

We have two core components of the hackathon that anyone can participate in as time allows. Both of these are expanded on further in our [Hackathon Getting Started](/events/qrl-games-winter-hackathon-2022/start) page.

1. **Community lead projects:** If you have more time during the holidays, you can start or participate in developing a project for QRL. This can be anything so long as it's QRL and game related, from building a QRL game to gamifying some aspect of the project.
2. **Hackathon hearty rewards:** During the last winter hackathon we had something called "reacty" rewards, which rewarded people for participating based on the reactions given. This extends that *outside* of the Discord and into Twitter as well. Anything QRL related works here, from tweets, to meme's and GitHub commits. There will be leaderboards!

### Gaming, what is it?

It's easy to think of games as either boardgames or video games, but *games* is really a concept for a form of play for entertainment and fun which is sometimes used as an educational tool. 

Ideas include:

- Incorporating QRL into gameplay
- Build a QRL game (digital or physical)
- Gamify any aspect of the project
- Quizzes & Puzzles
- Use the DRAND as a source of randomness to a game

### Rewards

Up to 25K quanta in prizes will be awarded as a prize pool for this winter's Hackathon.
