### Updates and Insights: The Future of QRL AMA with lead developer Kaushal Kumar Singh

In our latest AMA session, we had the pleasure of sitting down with Kaushal Kumar Singh, the lead developer of the QRL project, to discuss the exciting advancements and future direction of Zond.

If you missed it, you'll want to check out the video below or the [associated blog](/blog/updates-and-insights-the-future-of-qrl-ama-with-kaushal-kumar-singh/) that gives some key highlights of what's covered.

### QRL Post-Quantum Panel w/ Anastasia Marchenkova & Konstantinos Karagiannis | Episode #1

Our intention for this new segment is for us to dive into the latest advancements, hurdles, and implications of post-quantum technologiesâ€¦ while importantly keeping it all in a conversational feel (thatâ€™s still approachable).

In this episode, QRL Show co-hosts Ryan and Michael from the $QRL core team are joined by two great guests in Anastasia Marchenkova & Konstantinos Karagiannis for an exciting hour long panel discussion.

We cover:

- How each of our guests got involved in quantum technology
- How do you explain quantum computers?
- Hashing
- Bringing quantum computers to scale
- Superposition
- How close (or far away) are we to quantum supremacy?
- NIST Standards, Bitcoin Taproot upgrade
- and much more

You definitely donâ€™t want to miss this episode...you can check it out in full below

## Zond Development

The Development team behind has been hard at work reviewing and refining code, adding tests, and releasing new tools to make the Zond more stable, user-friendly, all the while being secure against future threats like quantum computing. 

- Multiple rounds of code reviews have been conducted focusing on various functions including reorganization (`ReorgNeeded`), prefetching (`StartPrefetcher`, `Prefetch`), transaction management (`writeKnownBlock`, `writeHeadBlock`), block handling (`RecoverFromBlocks`, `WriteHeadBlock`, `WriteCanonicalHash`), signature verification (`BlockSignatureBatch`, `VerifyHeaders`), and [more](/weekly/).
- Ongoing code reviews for insertChain and chain reorganization (reorg).
- More unit tests to improve test coverage.
- Version 0.1.2 of `wallet.js` has been released on GitHub
- New type description for the Dilithium wallet.



## The QRL Community

### Sticker Contest

For the month of July, The QRL Team hosted a design contest for our new sticker packs! These packs will be utilized with our education/university outreach program that will focus on establishing relationships with students/universities with programs centered around cryptography and will seek to promote awareness and collaboration with the QRL at a higher education level. 

Below are some of the entries from the QRL Community. Feel like you missed out? Be sure to join our community over on [Discord](/discord) to get notifications on community events like this.
