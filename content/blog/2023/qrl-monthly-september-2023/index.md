## Development

### QRL Zond Development

Several changes and improvements have been made to the execution node and related packages. One notable change is the unification of the `pqaccounts` and account packages into a single account package. Additionally, the `pqcrypto` package has undergone fixes and updates, including changes to the sign function.

The update also introduces a constant named `DilithiumSignatureLength` and makes various changes to transaction data and API to support Dilithium-based wallets. This includes added and initializing `DilithiumWithdrawalPrefixByte`, `ZondAddressWithdrawalPrefixByte` & `DomainDilithiumToExecutionChange` in config, fields which are used in the `staking-deposit-cli` for staking deposits and withdrawal.

This includes updates to the `RPCTransaction API` with new fields for PublicKey and Signature. Transaction marshalling has been updated to accommodate these new fields for `Dilithium` compatibility.

Several bug fixes and unit test updates have been implemented, and successful testing has been conducted for making and signing transactions from the CLI. Transaction Pool in the `Execution Node` has also been tested successfully, including fund transfers between `Dilithium` wallets.

The update covers progress in validator staking, including the exit of validators and withdrawal of balances. Non-required flags have been removed from the staking-deposit-cli, and various bug fixes and improvements have been made.

It won't be too much longer before everybody gets to try out the beta version of the QRL Zond beta-testnet network! The majority of the time is spent testing newly added functionality before it is made available to the team in order to ensure that appropriate documentation is created.

Generally:

- Node stability test âœ…
- Testing of validator staking deposit and withdrawal âœ…
- Testing of transfer of funds using dilithium wallet ðŸ”Ž <-- in Progress
- Testing of contract deployment using dilithium wallet
- Testing of contract interaction using dilithium wallet
- Final cosmetic changes and basic documentation to install, run, stake and de-stake
