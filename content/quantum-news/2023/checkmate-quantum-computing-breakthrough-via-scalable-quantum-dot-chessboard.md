blurb: |
  Researchers at QuTech, a collaboration between the Delft University of Technology and TNO, have developed a new method for addressing quantum dots that could enable the operation of larger gate-defined quantum dot systems. The method uses a chessboard-like approach, where quantum dots are addressed using a combination of horizontal and vertical lines, similar to how chess pieces are addressed with letters and numbers. This approach reduces the number of control lines needed to address multiple qubits, potentially enabling the scaling up of quantum systems. The researchers also highlight the importance of improving the quality of qubits, with recent demonstrations showing a 99.992% fidelity. Additionally, the researchers discuss the potential application of quantum dot systems for quantum simulation, as they have shown that an array of germanium quantum dots can be used for rudimentary simulations of resonating valence bonds. The researchers are now focused on scaling up the chessboard circuits and exploring the possibility of interconnecting them to build even larger quantum circuits.

  seamlessly integrated to a chessboard motif. Every quantum dot, like a pawn on a
  chessboard, is uniquely identifiable and controllable using a coordinate system
  of letters and numbers.
