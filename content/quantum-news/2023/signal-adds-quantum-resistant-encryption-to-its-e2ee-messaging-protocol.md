blurb: |
  Signal has announced that it upgraded its end-to-end communication protocol to use quantum-resistant encryption keys to protect users from future attacks.

  Signal explains that its "X3DH" (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) key agreement protocol has been upgraded to "PQXDH" (Post-Quantum Extended Diffie-Hellman), which incorporates quantum-resistant secret key generation mechanisms for Signal's end-to-end encryption (E2EE) specification.
