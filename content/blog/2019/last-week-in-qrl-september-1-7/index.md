## Introduction

We are now into the final quarter of 2019. Recently, quantum computing has been back in the news in a bigger way, with [reports of increased levels of private investment in space](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02935-4), as well as continued attention being paid by governments. We are also continuing to post job openings (more on this below), as we look to strategically grow the team ahead of our next development objectives. Finally, we will have the September Community Nomination recipient sometime later this week or next week.

You can see these [job postings on angel.co](https://angel.co/company/theqrl/jobs). We have received some interesting applications already, but want to cast as wide a net as possible to maximize the likelihood of finding the ideal candidate.
