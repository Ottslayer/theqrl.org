blurb: |
  Engineers at North Carolina State University (NCSU) have discovered a new form of silicon called Q-silicon with properties that could be beneficial for quantum computers and spintronics. Q-silicon exhibits ferromagnetism at room temperature, making it suitable for data storage and potentially enabling advancements in spintronics. It also demonstrates enhanced hardness and superconductivity, which could further aid spintronics and quantum computing.
