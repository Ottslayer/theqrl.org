blurb: |
  The Uttar Pradesh Government in India has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Innogress and GAN Tech UK to establish the Indraprastha Quantum Data Center (IQDC), a new data center dedicated to quantum computing. The IQDC aims to house a million-qubit-powered quantum computer, although no exact deadline for the project has been given. Innogress and GAN Tech UK are seeking quantum computing technology partners and investors for the project, which is estimated to cost between $300 million and $500 million. The IQDC will be located in Greater Noida, which already houses traditional data centers from companies such as NTT and Yotta.
