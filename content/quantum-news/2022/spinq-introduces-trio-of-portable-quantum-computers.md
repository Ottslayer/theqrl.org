blurb: |
  Switch-Science has just announced a trio of quantum computing products. The company claims they are the world's first portable quantum computers. SpinQ Technology, a Chinese quantum computing company based in Shenzen, makes them.

  The new "quantops" - the Gemini Mini, the Gemini and the Triangulum - have differing complexities and designs. Yet all of them feature a fully-integrated quantum computing system that's capable of operating at room temperature.
