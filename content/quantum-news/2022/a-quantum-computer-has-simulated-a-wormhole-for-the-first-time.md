A quantum computer has been used to simulate a holographic wormhole for the first time. The simulation used only nine quantum bits, or qubits, so it was very low-resolution.

Using a more powerful quantum computer could help bring the image into focus. That is crucial because some theories of quantum gravity are difficult or even impossible to completely understand using only classical computing.
