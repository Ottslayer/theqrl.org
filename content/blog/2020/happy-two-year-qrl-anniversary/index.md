**2 years ago**, QRL mainnet was released on [26 Jun 2018](https://explorer.theqrl.org/block/0/), and has operated a fully post-quantum secure blockchain network *not only* *without* incident such as lost funds or a network hiccup, but also with the same capacity of the bitcoin network. **It can, and has been done.**

This stability is thanks to mainnet not only running one and a half years of testnet, right back to the seminal github commit on [16 Oct 2016](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/commit/1f2de1cd469f0415ea6d9ff7a6dffe39d3f3ac62) from Peter Waterland (surg0r), but also to our two audits from [red4sec](/blog/red4sec-security-audit-concludes-a-summary) and [x41 D-sec](https://www.x41-dsec.de/) before the final release.

Relative to the date of this blog, this brings QRL, as a codebase, and the corresponding [whitepaper](https://github.com/theQRL/Whitepaper/blob/master/QRL_whitepaper.pdf) release, to three-and-a-half years of age.
