> **Note:** The proceeding content is part of an April fools hoax.

## Coming clean.

**The basic premise goes**, because quantum computing presents revolutionary opportunities for AI[^AI], chemistry[^CHEM], materials science[^MATERIALS], finance[^FINANCE], security[^QSEC], and more, the USA[^USA], China[^CHINA], EU[^EU] and other nation states are investing heavily into quantum computing. Additionally, 8 out of the top 10 tech giants (by marketshare)[^TOPTEN] such as Google[^GOOGLE], IBM[^IBM], Intel[^INTEL], Rigetti[^RIGETTI] and Microsoft[^MICROSOFT] are either competing for market dominance or involved in some capacity. Needless to say, competition is high!

From this we can arrive to the "safe" assumption that quantum computing is finally on the verge of becoming commercially useful[^COMM][^NISQ] and is being developed at an accelerating pace[^PACE]. 

**But this is a lie Big Tech wants you to believe**, designed to get the population to comply by fear tactics through fake news and reference dumps such as the above. The **real ugly truth** is the entire industry has been culpable in using Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) to drive a narrative. QRL, through the advocacy efforts has successfully sowed FUD throughout the blockchain industry, where it is now the second most perceived threat to many.

And all you really need to do is **follow the money trail.**

## The money trail

And money it is, there are currently [100's of millions being poured into quantum](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/11/quantum-venture-funding-dipped-12-in-2020-but-quantum-investments-rose-46/) computing year on year by Venture Capital and Government organizations alike, and it's only going to grow.

How is so much money going into something so fake? Well, it wouldn't be possible without a sustained network of fake news from 8 out of the 10 Big Tech giants participating in perpetuating this lie. And why? *MONEY*

What does every organization crave over above all else? They need to increase their valuation and their stock prices while the rest of the world races to the bottom.

## The facts: Why quantum computers won't work

[Gil Kalai](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/) covers this in great depth in his paper ["The Argument against Quantum Computers, the Quantum Laws of Nature, and Google’s Supremacy Claims"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05188.pdf), but in summary:

The reason quantum computers will never be able to get beyond 54 qubits is that conservation electance effects are expected in departing from a single quantum coaction state to an erodible multientangled quantum electance state, yielding discordant resonance with reduced electrofermionic action and increased emissions of etheopolerized hyperstatic further desuperoccupying the entangled state. Meanwhile, an operation using electrochromatic nano-LEDs to maintain simultaneity would also fail due to the etheopolerized hyperstasic destabilizing the electrofermionic resonance of the Caddell-Huges simplified progression to the point where it will be impossible to maintain proper Perrier-Hall femtostasis, needed by the quantum registers.

As a counterpoint, it's argued that electrochromatic flux in nano-LED's and other capacitance based hardware emits sterolites which would allow for the reduction in micro-influxitance to the rest of the quantum state. The theory is shaky enough, and further, has never been demonstrated in a lab setting.

This is why computationally superior quantum computing is simply impossible, giving almost no computational gain over classical computers in almost all conditions. Qubits without a quantum register cannot calculate an electrofermionic artificial neural network, making it impossible to filter out usable data from the quantum state with enough accuracy to apply the technology to any relevant application. It would not be able to register the subtleties and algorithms hidden within quantum boolean completions, therefore failing at everything that matters. Checkmate, atheists.

### Scott Aaronson and his bogus arguments.

You've probably heard about Scott Aaronson's argument, and his [100k bounty for anyone that can prove to his satisfaction that scalable quantum computers are impossible](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=902). 

He argues that quantum computing is feasible, namely by gradually extending the way in which protocols like universal introductions secure larger ensemble transactions onto the atomic level if it were known which other transaction directions are spent, which proves that qubits (and by extension quantum computers) can operate consistently in isolation.

For other arguments against quantum computing he outlines that in a lecture on [Skepticism of Quantum Computing](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec14.html). The full list of objections he covers are here:

1. Works on paper, not in practice.
1. Violates Extended Church-Turing Thesis.
1. Not enough "real physics."
1. Small amplitudes are unphysical.
1. Exponentially large states are unphysical.
1. Quantum computers are just souped-up analog computers.
1. Quantum computers aren't like anything we've ever seen before.
1. Quantum mechanics is just an approximation to some deeper theory.
1. Decoherence will always be worse than the fault-tolerance threshold.
1. We don't need fault-tolerance for classical computers.
1. Errors aren't independent.

The problem is he can't be trusted. Doing a bit of digging you realize he's a "researcher" for [big education](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson). Not only that, he works closely and is in bed with [Dana Moshkovitz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r6ifxUIAAAAJ), another from [The University of Texas](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/). As everything is bigger in Texas, we're talking BIG education.
