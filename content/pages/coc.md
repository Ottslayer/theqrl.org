### Effective Date: 2022-03-09

**Code of Conduct** (tl;dr. Be decent)

The QRL community is a global community working together to participate in positive, forward-thinking, good-faith discussions. This includes people from all walks of life, from all ages, backgrounds, and disciplines.

Naturally, disagreements among such a diverse community are bound to happen, and it’s important that we try to understand why so that we can resolve differing views constructively. All discussions should strive to be initiated and maintained in a considerate and respectful manner.

1. **__DO NOT__ spam, scam, shill, or otherwise use this area to promote your, or someone else’s, product/platform.**. Open dialog, including about other projects, are allowed, but using the QRL community as an opportunity to solely promote/shill a platform isn't permitted.
2. **__DO NOT__ organize, participate in, or encourage harassment/harm towards anyone.** *Harassment and discrimination are unacceptable and is antithetical to an open and welcoming community.* Harassment consists of repeated and persistent behaviour towards an individual to torment, undermine, frustrate or provoke a reaction from that person. Despite the varying forms of harassment and discrimination, they all have one thing in common: they are unacceptable. No one should have to feel unsafe or unwelcome in the QRL communities.
3. **__DO NOT__ use vulgar language that is not family friendly.** This includes no profanity, bigotry, attacks, threats, vulgar or violent language, concealed or otherwise. If it’s not appropriate to say around young kids, it’s not going to be appropriate in our official QRL communities.
4. **__DO NOT__ incite or encourage illegal or market manipulation activities.** Promoting leaks, buying/selling drugs, tax evasion, pyramid schemes, or conspiring to perform a pump/dump, along with anything laid out in the community platforms Terms of Service (ToS) isn’t permitted.
5. **__DO NOT__ partake in deceptive activities or actions.** Usernames which are deceptive (ie. coo, ceo, founder…), or advertising in nature (url’s, etc) aren't permitted. Referral links and the use of URL shortening services is a form of deceptive activity as it obfuscates the child url. 
6. **__DO NOT__ partake in doxxing, or posts that resemble doxxing.** Doxxing is the practice of researching and broadcasting private or identifiable information about an individual or organization. Posts that resemble doxxing will be removed.
7. **__DO NOT__ participate in a bad-faith manner.** Behaviour done intentionally to cause mischief, drama, or  toxicity to a community, as well as those who toe-the-line, are acting in bad-faith. Repeated use of knowingly false claims to try and sow a narrative would also be acting in bad-faith.
8. **__DO__ participate in a good-faith manner.** Behaviour with good intentions, from a mindset of engaging in a toxic-free, respectful, meaningful, forward-moving way would be considered in good-faith. This attitude is part of the foundation that fosters the growth of healthy communities and should be extended to other projects and communities as well.

Moderation resolutions are up to the moderator's discretion, though will always try to act in good faith by escalating first, such as by giving a timeout, warning, or kicking first.

Our moderators are responsible for maintaining the inclusive and friendly environment we aspire to create here: please be respectful of their requests and decisions.
