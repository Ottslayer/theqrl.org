## Introduction

September is upon us, and with it the first inklings of Autumn crispness ready to drive out the Summer heat. At QRL, there has been a flutter of activity both within the team itself, as well as in our interactions with outside organizations/individuals. Unfortunately, a significant portion of this activity cannot be discussed in detail yet. The best of the rest is below.

This month’s Community Nomination Award was not included in last week’s or today’s blog because there has been a slight delay in confirming the recipient. A separate blog on the August Community Nomination Award recipient should be forthcoming in the next week or so.
