From being the size of a briefcase to the size of a pencil case, the cellphone has gone from literally just a mobile telephone, to today being accurately described as a mobile computer. Given the decentralized, international, internet-based nature of cryptocurrency, it is no surprise that people want easy and secure access to their cryptocurrency wallets, wherever they are. That dream has now been realized in the form of the QRL mobile wallet.

At QRL, empowering our users is always on our mind, and a fast, functional mobile wallet interface is a necessary element in the pursuit of that goal. Today, we are happy to announce that the QRL Mobile Wallet is fully launched on both Android and iOS devices. You can find them on the [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1&mt=8) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl).

We cannot emphasize enough the hard work and dedication that Adem, our Mobile Developer, has put into these applications, and we are very thankful for him (you can go thank him yourself at his Twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/ademcan_net)).

As the above images indicate, some of the functionality available to users of the mobile wallet include (but are not limited to):

* Offline wallet creation
* Multiple wallet support
* Send/Receive transactions
* QR code integration

A Few Notes:

* The QRL Mobile Wallet App is not available in China
* The application may take some time to be added to the search indexes of the Google and Apple stores, respectively. However, you can access them via our links ([Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl)) ([Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1&mt=8)), and they should appear in searches soon.

Between the [web wallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org/), [desktop wallet](https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/releases/), [Ledger integration](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live), and now the mobile wallet, there is a well-rounded variety of options for any given user to access their Quanta.

We are always looking to improve our current offerings, as well as to identify and pursue those things we have not yet considered. To that end, we are always appreciative of constructive feedback from our wonderful community of users. Please feel free to let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/V5ZDUAr), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qrledger), or [GitHub](https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/issues), how you like the mobile app and if there are any improvements we should consider.
