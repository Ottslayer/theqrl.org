With solid headway being made on the NFT front, we’re putting a call to action out to all developers to be the first NFT platform providers for Quantum Secure NFTs.

## Calling on all Developers with interest in being the first QRL NFT platform providers

In December, we announced that NFT support is [coming to QRL](/blog/announcing-preliminary-quantum-secure-nfts-and-cta/). Over the past few months, the QRL team has been making solid progress on the NFT front with the launch of testnet, allowing for the creation and transfer of NFTs, including [supported tooling](https://nft-tools.theqrl.org/).

With the full NFT genesis launch expected later on this year, we’re calling for developers who have interest in being part of building out an NFT provider platform.

For those who have interest, please contact us at info@theqrl.org 

## What are NFTs & NFT Providers?

An NFT is a Non-Fungible Token. 

It is a digital asset that can be transferred, stored or traded just like any other cryptocurrency. The term was first introduced by the crypto game CryptoKitties.

NFTs are often used in games as rewards for players who have reached certain milestones or completed certain tasks. Other NFTs can be used to represent virtual assets that are not fungible in nature such as collectibles, artwork, and other virtual items.

**An NFT platform provider** is a marketplace which allows people a place to curate NFTs, as well as to buy, sell, and trade these digital assets.
