## Fusion Signatures

Update from Geometry Labs: NIST has informed [Geometry Labs](https://geometrylabs.io/) that they are only moving forward with many-times signature schemes at this time and will not include one-time signature schemes like Fusion in the current standardisation process. Although their narrow focus is disappointing, it's encouraging to hear from them that they thought Fusion was an interesting one-time signature approach and encouraged Geometry Labs to publish it for further peer-review. 

If NIST decides to pursue one-time signature approaches in the future, Fusion signatures can always be resubmitted.
