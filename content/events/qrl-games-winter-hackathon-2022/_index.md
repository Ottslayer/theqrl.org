Building on the success of [QRL Hackathon 2022](/events/qrl-hackathon-2022) in Amsterdam, we're excited to announce our upcoming [QRL Games - Winter Hackathon 2022](/events/qrl-games-winter-hackathon-2022/) (virtual).

The main theme for Winter Hackathon 2022 is all about games. Whether itâ€™s taking inspiration from a nostalgic game you played growing up or gamifying any aspect of the project that your quantum-resistant heart desires, the options here are endless.
