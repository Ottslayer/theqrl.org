blurb: "Quantum computing company Quantinuum made three more announcements at IEEE
  Quantum Week 2022. Announcements include another quantum volume record, a new method
  to make two-qubit gates with higher fidelity and greater efficiency, and a milestone
  achievement of more than a half-million downloads of its software.\n\n1. **Highlight
  1: Shuttling ion pairs through intersections and negotiating 90 degree turns:**
  It may not sound significant, but this research provides the capability to execute
  Quantinuum’s long term roadmap for future generations of H-series quantum computers.
  Ion trap researchers have been working on this problem for years. Prior to Quantinuum’s
  research, it was believed that the only way for paired ions to move through zones
  was to first separate the pair, then move them through junctions one at a time.
  That solution would have significantly increased processing time.\n2. **Highlight
  2: Closing the gap on fault-tolerant quantum error correction:** Fault tolerant
  quantum error correction will make it possible to build quantum computers with enough
  qubits to solve problems far beyond the reach of today's supercomputers. Quantinuum
  researchers were able to construct a logical entangling circuit that had a higher
  fidelity than its physical counterpart.\n\n17 other significant improvements over
  the last 12 months are:\n\n1. September 27, 2022: Quantinuum Sets New Record with
  Highest Ever Quantum Volume of 8192\n2. August 4, 2022: Logical qubits start outperforming
  physical qubits\n3. July 11, 2022: Quantum Milestone: Turning a Corner with Trapped
