We would like to warn users of a fake QRL wallet in the Microsoft app store.

This application has not been developed or authorised by the QRL Foundation or any QRL contributors and there is a high likelihood that our open source software may have been altered in order to steal funds.

All genuine QRL apps and services are linked from our [theqrl.org](https://theqrl.org) homepage where the genuine version of our wallet for Windows can be found.

We have reached out to Microsoft for intervention.
