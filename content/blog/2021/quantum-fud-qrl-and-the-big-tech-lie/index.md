## Coming clean.

**The basic premise goes**, as quantum computing presents revolutionary opportunities for AI[^AI], chemistry[^CHEM], materials science[^MATERIALS], finance[^FINANCE], security[^QSEC], and more, the USA[^USA], China[^CHINA], EU[^EU] and other nation states are investing heavily into quantum computing. With 8 out of the top 10 tech giants (by marketshare)[^TOPTEN] such as Google[^GOOGLE], IBM[^IBM], Intel[^INTEL], Rigetti[^RIGETTI] and Microsoft[^MICROSOFT] either competing for market dominance or involved in some capacity, competition is high!

From this we can arrive to the "safe" assumption that quantum computing is finally on the verge of becoming commercially useful[^COMM][^NISQ] and is being developed at an accelerating pace[^PACE]. 

The takeaway here is that this is real, and while it presents exciting opportunities, it also brings with it important security considerations and precautions that we should be taking.

**But this is a lie Big Tech wants you to believe**, designed to get the population, and the rest of industry to comply with fear tactics and fake news reference dumps. The real ugly truth is we used this fear to create uncertainty and denial (FUD) in the minds of many, and through the advocacy efforts of QRL for the blockchain industry, where it remains as the second most perceived threat to many.

And all you really need to do is **follow the money trail.**

## The money trail

And money it is, there are currently [100's of millions being poured into quantum](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/11/quantum-venture-funding-dipped-12-in-2020-but-quantum-investments-rose-46/) computing year on year by Venture Capital and Government organizations alike, and it's only going to grow.

How is so much money going into something so fake? Well, it wouldn't be possible without a sustained network of fake news from 8 out of the 10 Big Tech giants participating in perpetuating this lie. And why? MONEY.

What does every organization crave over above all else? They need to increase their valuation and their stock prices while the rest of the world races to the bottom.

## The facts: Why quantum computers won't work

[Gil Kalai](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/) covers this in great depth in his paper ["The Argument against Quantum Computers, the Quantum Laws ofNature, and Google’s Supremacy Claims"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05188.pdf), but in summary:

The reason quantum computers won't work is that conservation electance effects are expected in going from single erodible quantum states yielding coaction, with reduction electrode action resolved and reduced quantities further desuperoccupying to existing action technologies, whereas an operation exhibiting impressive enhancement will maintain simultaneity with head=side electrochromic LEDs (required work atop a 90 h battery & among dual types–Caddell simplified progression to stimulating about orbit needing co-operation of tubes pushing centeres). 

This is why computationally superior quantum computing is not possible, giving a weak front-load to computational gain over many conditions. Qubits without a quantum register cannot calculate an artificial neural network, were given by Hawking 4 at 150 K using the wave bands corresponding to hard hats and electron guns making a form of entanglement implausible today. We do not comprehend the subtleties or algorithm hidden within Boolean completions, therefore this parallel of evolution fumbling 10^-23 of self reconciling incongruous processing available seemingly gives a runtime, and apparently not often enough whereas predominantly most is taken without providing conserved intrinsic information.

Checkmate atheists.

### Scott Aaronson and his bogus arguments.

You've probably heard about Scott Aaronson's argument, and his [100k bounty for anyone that can prove to his satisfaction that scalable quantum computers are impossible](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=902). 

He argues that quantum computing is feasible, namely by gradually extending the way in which protocols like universal introductions secure larger ensemble transactions onto the atomic level if it were known which other transaction directions are spent, which proves that qubits (and by extension quantum computers) can operate consistently in isolation.

For other arguments against quantum computing he outlines that in a lecture on [Skepticism of Quantum Computing](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec14.html). The full list of objections he covers are here:

1. Works on paper, not in practice.
1. Violates Extended Church-Turing Thesis.
1. Not enough "real physics."
1. Small amplitudes are unphysical.
1. Exponentially large states are unphysical.
1. Quantum computers are just souped-up analog computers.
1. Quantum computers aren't like anything we've ever seen before.
1. Quantum mechanics is just an approximation to some deeper theory.
1. Decoherence will always be worse than the fault-tolerance threshold.
1. We don't need fault-tolerance for classical computers.
1. Errors aren't independent.

The problem is he can't be trusted. Doing a bit of digging you realize he's a "researcher" for [big education](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson). Not only that, he works closely and is in bed with [Dana Moshkovitz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r6ifxUIAAAAJ), another from [The University of Texas](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/). As everything is bigger in Texas, we're talking BIG education.
