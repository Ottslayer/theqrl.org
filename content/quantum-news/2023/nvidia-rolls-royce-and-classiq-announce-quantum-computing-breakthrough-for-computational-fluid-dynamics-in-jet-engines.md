blurb: |
  NVIDIA, Rolls-Royce, and Classiq have achieved a quantum computing breakthrough for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in jet engines. They have designed and simulated the world's largest quantum computing circuit, measuring 10 million layers deep with 39 qubits. This development paves the way for more efficient modeling of jet engine designs using both classical and quantum computing methods.
