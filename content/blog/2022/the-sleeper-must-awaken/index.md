# State of QRL

First off, the hackathon in Amsterdam was a fantastic affair. It was brilliant to meet up with so many members of the passionate QRL community in person. It was certainly successful and I very much look forward to a bigger and better successor event next year - the only questions are when and where?

Development continues apace with multiple new developers joining the project in recent months. The QRL network is about to become a very exciting place to be with the advent of POS and smart contract capabilities at the next major release. Soon it will once again be the state of the art.

QRL is now well into a 7th year of existence - a lot has changed since I first started typing into the void on a Macbook pro in 2016. The crypto ecosystem is completely unrecognisable, the market capitalization has exploded and crypto is now on the verge of becoming mainstream. Despite transforming from a nascent idea to a surging alternative asset class, the vast majority of the space remains as susceptible to a quantum singularity event now as during first keypress of this project. QRL still has great potential to grow and protect the ecosystem from seemingly inevitable but uncertain quantum computing advancements.

In the next iteration QRL will have great potential for third party projects to *build on QRL*. Be it defi, nft's, DAO's, DEX's, gaming projects intersecting with QRL, communications apps utilising ephemeral and the mainnet qrl chain as a decentralised address book, eternal contracts which *never* require an upgrade, the possibilities are endless and limited only by the imagination of the userbase. Crypto is now so much more than just peer-to-peer value transfer.

# Change is coming?

> "I'll miss the sea, but a person needs new experiences. They jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow. Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken."

The more eagle eyed will spot part of this quote from the QRL explorer page. The text is embedded into the QRL genesis block. Great things get done during bear markets. It is time for QRL to awaken and reach it's full potential.


Important changes to project governance and funding will soon be announced. The first step of this will be a public grants system aimed at supporting: core development, research, education and documentation and for the first time, community.

It is time for the community to *build on QRL*. More details to follow.
