A node API update has unexpectedly caused people to be unable to load transactions, account balances with mobile, desktop, and web wallet clients.

The web wallet has been fixed and can be used in the meantime as workaround at [https://wallet.theqrl.org](https://wallet.theqrl.org)

Mobile and desktop clients arenâ€™t far behind for being updated. *This post will be updated as they become available*.
