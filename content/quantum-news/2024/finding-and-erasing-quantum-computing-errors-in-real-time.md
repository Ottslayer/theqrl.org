blurb: "Researchers, led by Jeff Thompson at Princeton University, have developed
  a novel method to detect and correct errors in quantum computers in real time, potentially
  making them up to ten times easier to correct. \n\nThis advancement, detailed in
  a [recent paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06438-1),
  focuses on identifying errors more easily than previous methods, which primarily
  aimed to reduce error probabilities. By utilizing a different set of energy levels
  within atoms to store qubits, the team can monitor qubits during computations and
  detect errors without destroying the qubits.\n"
