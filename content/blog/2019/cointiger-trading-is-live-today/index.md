As the above graphic illustrates, yesterday, today, and tomorrow QRL will be integrated into the [CoinTiger](https://www.cointiger.com/en-us/#/login) exchange platform. As you can see on their [Medium post](https://medium.com/@cointiger/cointiger-will-list-quantum-resistant-ledger-qrl-at-16-00-on-22-8-2019-utc-8-100k-qrl-token-5335ad9816cf) announcing the integration, and our [subsequent tweet](https://twitter.com/QRLedger/status/1164458435330469888) at 8:00am UTC this morning, QRL is now live to be [traded on CoinTiger](https://www.cointiger.com/en-us/#/trade_pro?coin=qrl_btc). CoinTiger will be running a few promotions, including a trading competition, over the first week following the listing. You can find details on all that [here](https://support.cointiger.one/hc/en-us/articles/360034680493-CoinTiger-Will-List-Quantum-Resistant-Ledger-QRL-at-16-00-on-22-8-2019-UTC-8-100K-QRL-Token-to-Give-Away-).

Liquidity has always been seen by the QRL team as a necessary component for a healthy, functioning, low-friction ecosystem. We are also keenly aware that acquiring more liquidity options for our users has been one of the top discussed issues in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zbAJ9YV), as well as one of the top requested additions to the ecosystem across all our social media.

Speaking more generally, liquidity is a balancing act. If a given asset is available to be traded on many platforms, but those platforms themselves are largely distinct and unconnected from one another, then issues of low liquidity, an unrepresentative amount of volatility, and even arbitrage can occur. Conversely, to have all of oneâ€™s liquidity eggs in one basket may pool volume, but it obviously exposes an asset to the potential of having its liquidity massively affected should that singular exchange be hacked, or shut down. Even less extreme events, like if it were to change trading minimums, deposit/withdrawal minimums, and/or fee schedules can affect its trading environment.

We are all excited about this new liquidity opportunity for our users and would like to thank the CoinTiger team for its help in integration.
