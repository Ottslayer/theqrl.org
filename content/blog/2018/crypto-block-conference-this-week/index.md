## What

CryptoBlockCon is a conference series that convenes four times a year, everywhere from Las Vegas to London, to discuss the future benefits & possibilities of blockchain technology & crypto assets. The traveling event serves to showcase companies who are using blockchain, educate current and future industry participants on blockchain technology, and serve as a platform for industry participants to network with one another.

## When

December 11–12, 2018

## Why

When we were approached with the opportunity to present at CBC 2018, we had to consider the various factors that make a given conference appearance worth it or not. We had to consider travel distance, the length and prominence of our presentation slot, what we would be presenting, and of course, weigh that against overall cost, both in time and money. When we looked at all of these factors, it made sense to seize this opportunity, and try to maximize it.

As always, if you will be in Las Vegas this week, whether you are there for the conference or not, and would like to meet up with us, please do not hesitate to reach out. It is always tons of fun to meet users and community members out in the real world. Barring an unforeseen event, this will be our last conference of 2018 — so this will be your last, best chance to see us in person before next year.
