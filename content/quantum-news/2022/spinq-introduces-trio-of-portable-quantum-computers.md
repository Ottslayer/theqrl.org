SpinQ Technology, a Chinese company based in Shenzhen, has introduced three new portable quantum computing products aimed at educational use: the Gemini Mini, the Gemini, and the Triangulum. These devices are designed to make physical quantum computing more accessible, though they feature limited capabilities with qubit counts maxing out at three. Utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin qubits, these systems operate at room temperature but face significant scalability issues and lack key quantum features like entanglement. The Gemini Mini is an entry-level two-qubit system priced around $8,104, while the more advanced Gemini and Triangulum models offer increased complexity and coherence times at significantly higher prices.
