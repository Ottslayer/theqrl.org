2. Go to Tools
3. Click on "Send Message"
4. Copy the code into the message area
5. Send transraction
6. **Come see us to claim a reward**. 1 tag = 1 Quanta (QRL)

## Step 5: Win the grand prize

All 34 stickers is enough to create a mnemonic! This opens a wallet (though you don't need to for the event)

When you head home (or before 4pm on Friday), come see us and we'll record your address and how much of the mnemonic you've completed.

After the event, we will select the winners and distribute the grand prizes accordingly.

> Had to catch a flight early? Contact us through our socials with a screenshot of the mnemonic and your QRL address and you'll be accounted for.
