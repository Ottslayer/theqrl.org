  with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. \n\nTheir results, together with other

The researchers have successfully created a large-scale array of optical tweezers that can trap over 6,100 neutral atoms across 12,000 sites, achieving new heights in several critical performance metrics for this technology.

They demonstrated:

- A **coherence time** of **12.6 seconds**, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. 
- **Trapping lifetimes** close to **23 minutes** in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high 
- **Imaging survival** of **99.98952%** in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. 

Their results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, their work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.
