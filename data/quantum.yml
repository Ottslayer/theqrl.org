  blurb: | 
    SandboxAQ acquires Cryptosense to enhance cybersecurity and encryption capabilities of its post-quantum cryptography solution. Financial details remained undisclosed. Amadeus Capital Partners led a $4.8 million round of funding, bringing total funding to $5.6 million. SandboxAQ has been selected by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology as one of twelve collaborators for the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.

    The company's board includes Eric Schmidt, who served as Google's CEO and chairman from 2001 to 2011. Cryptosense is now moving under the U.S. SandboxAQ said this acquisition will leverage a natural complementary and help realize synergies. "Building the Cryptosense organically would take more time, and it is critical to get this important technology in use fast".

- title: Quantinuum Is On A Roll - 17 Significant Quantum Computing Achievements In 12 Months

  blurb: | 
    Quantum computing company Quantinuum made three more announcements at IEEE Quantum Week 2022. Announcements include another quantum volume record, a new method to make two-qubit gates with higher fidelity and greater efficiency, and a milestone achievement of more than a half-million downloads of its software.

    1. **Highlight 1: Shuttling ion pairs through intersections and negotiating 90 degree turns:** It may not sound significant, but this research provides the capability to execute Quantinuum’s long term roadmap for future generations of H-series quantum computers. Ion trap researchers have been working on this problem for years. Prior to Quantinuum’s research, it was believed that the only way for paired ions to move through zones was to first separate the pair, then move them through junctions one at a time. That solution would have significantly increased processing time.
    2. **Highlight 2: Closing the gap on fault-tolerant quantum error correction:** Fault tolerant quantum error correction will make it possible to build quantum computers with enough qubits to solve problems far beyond the reach of today's supercomputers. Quantinuum researchers were able to construct a logical entangling circuit that had a higher fidelity than its physical counterpart.
    
    17 other significant improvements over the last 12 months are:

    Cloudflare has launched post-quantum cryptography support for all websites and APIs served through its network. This will introduce quantum computer-proof encryption for all sites using Cloudflare, which accounts for 19.1% of all websites according to W3Techs. Researchers estimate the market for such solutions will be worth $476.8 million by 2030. 
    
    Cloudflare isn't the only CDN provider looking to secure the Internet from quantum computing threats. Other vendors like PQShield, which announced raising $20 million in funding earlier this year, are leveraging post-quantum cryptography to enable enterprises to develop secure cryptographic solutions for messaging platforms, apps and mobile technologies.

    In 2013, Rigetti Computing began its push to make quantum computers. That effort could bear serious fruit starting in 2023, the company said Friday.

    That's because next year, the Berkeley, California-based company plans to deliver both its fourth-generation machine, called Ankaa, and an expanded model called Lyra. The company hopes those machines will usher in "quantum advantage," when the radically different machines mature into devices that actually deliver results out of the reach of conventional computers, said Rigetti founder and Chief Executive Chad Rigetti.

    “We believed we had cracked the code for building a million-qubit quantum computer,” Dr. Shadbolt said. “Even though that's a huge number, the secret seemed simple. All we had to do was use the same process as the one being used to put billions of transistors into cell phones. We felt a large quantum computer wouldn’t exist in our lifetime unless we figured out how to build it in a semiconductor foundry. That idea has been turned into reality. We are now building quantum chips next to laptops and cell phone chips on the GlobalFoundries 300-millimeter platform.”
