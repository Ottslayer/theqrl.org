Researchers in China have developed a quantum light source using gallium nitride (GaN), a common semiconductor traditionally used in blue light-emitting diodes. This development is seen as a significant step towards creating functional quantum chips. The GaN-based quantum light source can generate pairs of entangled light particles, which are essential for transmitting information within quantum systems. Additionally, this device offers a broader wavelength range than existing quantum light sources. The researchers suggest that this advancement could lead to more efficient and easily integrated quantum chips, with vast potential applications in quantum computing. They remain optimistic about the future use of GaN in fabricating all-on-chip quantum photonic integrated circuits.
