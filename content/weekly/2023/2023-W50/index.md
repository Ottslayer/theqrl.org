## Public Beta-testnet v1 Date Set for January 15th, 2024

After months of dedication, development, and collaboration, we are delighted to unveil the official launch date for our public beta-testnet v1: **January 15th, 2024!**

### What to expect

As we unveil the entrance to our public beta-testnet v1 from devnet, developers across the globe are invited to delve into and interact with our platform and ecosystem. This encompasses web3 and EVM smart contract capabilities, all built upon a post-quantum secure foundation. Those with experience in the Ethereum ecosystem will find themselves right at home in this innovative environment. 

In this developmental phase, as we refine nodes and work towards public beta-testnet v2 (with additional improvements & incorporating a new address format), there is a prime opportunity to construct essential ecosystem components. This includes the development of wallets, explorers, and various tools that will enhance the overall functionality and user experience within our platform.

More details will be shared through documentation and other media as the release date gets closer.
