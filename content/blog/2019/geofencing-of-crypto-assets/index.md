It has come to our attention that Bittrex will be geofencing 32 crypto assets including QRL from US customers on 2019–06–21. Trading for non-US customers will continue unchanged on the Bittrex International platform.

Full announcement can be read [here](https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028996652).

Whilst we have no more information on this than has been released publicly by Bittrex, we support their efforts in evolving the cryptocurrency ecosystem and hope that their geofencing will be short-lived, especially as the open source QRL ecosystem is now mature and QRL is so widely distributed around the world.

In the last few days the QRL chain has grown past 500k blocks; a planned hard fork to bring on-chain decentralised governance, numerous iterative improvements and multi-signature wallet support is not far away. Mobile platform support, Keybase integration for identity proofs, and Ledger hardware wallet support have recently been added to the QRL, with Ledger X support, multi-tree support and Ledger Live integration right around the corner.

We are one of the few projects to take post-quantum security seriously and are proud that the entire ledger is already PQ-secure with a professionally audited codebase. Cryptocurrency should be impervious to technical attack and post-quantum insecurity remains a critical vulnerability in the armor of this nascent asset class.

Development progress aside, the near term priority for the project will be procuring an additional listing on a major Asian exchange as soon as is practical.
