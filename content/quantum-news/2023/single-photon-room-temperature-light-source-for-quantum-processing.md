blurb: |
  Researchers in Japan have developed an ytterbium-doped optical fibre that works at room temperature for cost-effective photonic quantum applications.

  The developed optical fibre with ytterbium atoms can be manufactured without the need for expensive cooling systems. This overcomes a significant hurdle and opens doors to various next-generation quantum information technologies.
