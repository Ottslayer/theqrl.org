## Highlights

### Strategic update: The Sleeper Must Awaken

{{< image "./images/h.sleeper.png" >}}

Today, crypto is so much more than just a peer-to-peer value transfer, with DeFi, NFTs, DAO's, DEX's and more coming into the space over the last few years. The market capitalization has exploded and blockchain technology is on the verge of entering the mainstream. 

QRL, being well into its 7th year of existence, is changing with that, introducing [smart-contracts](/features/smart-contracts/) for programmable assets, and [Proof-of-Stake](/features/proof-of-stake) as a more efficient and robust consensus mechanism. 

Important changes to project governance and funding will soon be announced. *The first step* of this will be a public grants system aimed at supporting: core development, research, education and documentation and for the first time, community.

More can be read in our [Sleeper Must Awaken](/blog/the-sleeper-must-awaken/) blog.

### OneQRL: Questions & Answers

Since the launch of [OneQRL.com](https://oneqrl.com) at the [2022 Hackathon](/events/qrl-hackathon-2022/), the OneQRL Team intentionally left the FAQ section unfinished.

Last month, the OneQRL Team got the community involved and gave a 10 Quanta reward to the most voted Questions/Answers each. This event lasted from **October 24th** to **October 31st**
