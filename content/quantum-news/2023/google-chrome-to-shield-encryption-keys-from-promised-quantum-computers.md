title: Google Chrome to shield encryption keys from promised quantum computers

blurb: |
  Google is deploying a hybrid key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) in its Chrome browser to protect the sharing of encryption secrets during the establishment of secure network connections. The new system, called X25519Kyber768, combines the X25519 elliptic curve algorithm and Kyber-768, a quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm. The move is in anticipation of future quantum computers that could potentially break existing encryption schemes. Google's early deployment of the technology is also practical for network administrators as it adds extra data to TLS ClientHello messages to strengthen security. The deployment of post-quantum encryption is seen as a necessary step in protecting valuable data shared over networks today and in the future.
