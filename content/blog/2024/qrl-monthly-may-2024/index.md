## Feature: Consensus 2024 by Coindesk

This year‚Äôs Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas by Coindesk, was a hive of innovation and forward-thinking, but one booth in particular stood out from the rest: the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL). As the only project equipped with provably post-quantum secure technology, using government-grade cryptography (XMSS), QRL drew crowds eager to glimpse into the future of blockchain security.


The team representing QRL at Consensus was nothing short of stellar, bringing expertise and passion to the forefront. Attendees had the pleasure of meeting:

- Iain Wood: Operational Manager
- James Gordon: Developer / Documentation
- Ryan Malinowski: Director of Advocacy
- Jack Matier: Director of Communications
- Michael Strike: Director of Outreach

Throughout the three-day Consensus conference, it was clear that most attendees recognized the quantum threat, and through our materials and discussions, we heightened their awareness of its immediate implications.

### QRL Show Live Episode from Consensus üìΩÔ∏è üîê üíª

QRL Show co-hosts Ryan and Michael from the QRL core team filmed a full in-person episode while at Consensus in Austin, TX.

In this episode, they cover:

- The sentiment of others in the space from individuals up to large institutions
- What people should be doing about the quantum threat, expert timelines, etc
- How is the cryptography QRL uses post-quantum secure?
- How quantum computing will impact every industry
- Where‚Äôs a best place to start for those interested in post-quantum securing their digital assets (Shor‚Äôs Algorithm, factorization, public/private keys).

### What's next?

We're not stopping at Consensus 2024 by Consensus. As the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) continues to make strides in blockchain security, the team is gearing up to attending a series of engaging and informative events.

## QRL Zond Development

For the month of May, significant progress has been made across various facets of our project. Our development team is currently implementing the JavaScript functions for XMSS sign and verification. Extensive code reviews are underway focusing on crucial components such as attestor verification and processing, state management, initial sync, epoch transitions, as well as the logic for validators' rewards and penalties.

We've successfully completed the [TrueBlocks](https://trueblocks.io/) fork indexing and are now validating and testing its integration with the explorer to ensure seamless functionality. On the front-end, maintenance updates have been applied to the zond-explorer and zond-wallet alpha releases, and the zond-wallet Progressive Web App (PWA) build is progressing well.

On the tooling side, experimental work is ongoing with the dilithium5 CLI tool, aimed at improving command-line operations. Furthermore, we've tackled several code reviews including the processes for withdrawal, proposer and attestor slashing, and rewards and penalties for validators.

Significant changes are also being applied to our web3.js to sync with the latest developments in Zond. Continuous reviews and updates are being made to improve the state and initial sync code, the epoch transition code, and the logic for rewards and penalties during each epoch.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in blockchain technology!
