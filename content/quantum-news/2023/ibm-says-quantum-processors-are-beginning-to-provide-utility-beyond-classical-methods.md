blurb: "IBM is one step closer to realizing a quantum computer with true utility that
  can outperform classical computers in certain workloads. The technology giant recently
  used its Quantum \"Eagle\" processor with 127 superconducting qubits to create entangled
  states that \"simulate the dynamics of spins in a model of material and accurately
  predict properties such as its magnetization.\" \n"

IBM is one step closer to realizing a quantum computer with true utility that can outperform classical computers in certain workloads. The technology giant recently used its Quantum "Eagle" processor with 127 superconducting qubits to create entangled states that "simulate the dynamics of spins in a model of material and accurately predict properties such as its magnetization."
