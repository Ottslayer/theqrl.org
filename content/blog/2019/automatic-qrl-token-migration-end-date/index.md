### Mark your calendars for June 15th, 2019 2000 UTC

The current token migration process is **automatic** once you have started the process and **almost immediate**.

*After* **June 15th, 2019**, however, the process for migrating ERC20s will be **manual,** and may take an **indeterminate amount of time**. *Additionally*, each manual migration will be evaluated on a **case-by-case basis**.

It’s *strongly* recommended that any and all users who still have QRL ERC20's to migrate them **BEFORE** the closure of automatic migration on June 15th, 2019.

[We have also outlined this in our documentation](https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/) to help keep everything in one spot and ensure everyone is on the same page with migration. The documentation page is the page we’ll be issuing *periodic reminders* with going forward.

Also on this documentation page you will find:

* Steps on [how to migrate today](https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#migration-steps), steps to migrate *manually* [after June 15th](https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#steps-after-june-15th), as well as the most frequently asked question, [what will happen to the unmigrated Quanta](https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#what-will-happen-to-the-qrl-erc20-tokens-and-the-reserved-quanta-for-migration-after-the-final-migration-end-date-).

* Not one, but *several* countdowns to keep track as well as a date & time localised to your timezone, and a link to timeanddate that provides *more* options for ensuring nobody misses the date.
