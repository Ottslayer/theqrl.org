*Development Updates, New Interview Released, Changing Format*

## Introduction

As you may have seen in the [blog released earlier today](/blog/decentralised-voting-and-trustless-autonomous-hard-forking), Ephemeral Messaging, Multisignature Wallets, and ledger-wide polls are some of the features that will be included in the next QRL hard-fork. We also have the audio from the [What Is Crypto Podcast ](https://soundcloud.com/whatiscrypto/episode-11-how-to-protect-bitcoin-from-quantum-computing-w-adam-koltun)(more on that below), and today another video interview was recorded (likely to be released later this month). We will also be slightly changing the format of this blog series moving forward (more on that below as well).

## Change To The Format Moving Forward

When we started this “Last ___ in QRL” blogs, we debated internally whether to make it a weekly or monthly blog. The question was one of whether or not we would have consistent enough content to fill out a weekly blog, as well as whether or not a monthly blog would be too infrequent to give a good sense of progress. We initially decided on a weekly blog, and for the past 54ish weeks that has come in the form of the “Last Week in QRL” blog. While the format has served us at times, ultimately the disparities in content available to us on a weekly basis has made it clear; these blogs will be more consistent, and more useful to the community, if delivered in a monthly manner.

## Development

## New Interview Released — What Is Crypto Podcast

A few weeks ago I sat down with Michael Nye of the “What Is Crypto” podcast to talk QRL, Quantum Computing, and blockchain in general. The audio is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VdNosP06URJb29IaH3PC3?si=NMKhSxL2R16XHiG1QZbKog) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/whatiscrypto/episode-11-how-to-protect-bitcoin-from-quantum-computing-w-adam-koltun) right now. The interview runs about 20 minutes long and is mostly introductory (the podcast is called “What Is Crypto” after all). It is always a pleasant opportunity to introduce new audiences to what QRL is, and why we need quantum resistance in blockchain today.
