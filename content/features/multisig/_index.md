### Overview of weighted-threshold multi-signature transactions

Critical to any trustless (and trusted) system is the ability to handle different methods of governance on how allocated funds can be spent.

The *weighted threshold* aspect refers to the ability to assign variable weights to any signatory. So in the committee example, it’s possible that a few members are higher ranking (whether by seniority or otherwise) and could be assigned a higher weight.

### Use Cases

- **Petty joint account:** Any signatory party can spend funds. Often used between two individuals with an established level of trust (couples).
- **Two-factor Authentication address:** As a way to add an extra level of security, it’s possible to setup a multisig address with two signatories, with the credentials spread between different devices and/or locations. In order to spend, a vote from both signatories would be required.
- **Committee in control of funds:** Allows for a select number of committee members to approve the spending of funds.
