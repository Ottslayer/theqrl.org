{{< image "./images/h.pqca.png" >}}

The QRL Foundation is happy to be a member of PQCA, a linux foundation project to advance the adoption of post-quantum cryptography, by producing high-assurance software implementations of standardized algorithms, and supporting the continued development and standardization of new post-quantum algorithms with software for evaluation and prototyping.

This proactive approach ensures that as quantum computing becomes more prevalent, our digital assets, financial transactions, and data remain secure against potentially groundbreaking quantum threats.

## Media

###  History of Cryptography: Behind The Code - Episode 5 

{{< youtube "UnApvzz1IAw" >}}

Here in Episode #5, we move all the way from early days of the internet through the how Digital Signature Algorithms work and what the future may look like for cryptographic security once sufficiently powerful enough quantum computers arrive in the future. 

### Twitter/X Web3 Global

{{< twitter user="web3globalmedia" id="1763169506023621081">}}

We have also partnered with Web3 Global - [@web3globalmedia](https://twitter.com/web3globalmedia), and explored engaging topics that resonate with both enthusiasts and skeptics of blockchain technology. Our first episode, we debated the pros and cons of "What Makes Crypto Fun," and delved into the excitement and innovation driving the world of cryptocurrency. In the second episode, we tackled the debate on "Doxxed or Undoxed, Which is Better?", or transparency versus anonymity in blockchain projects.
