blurb: |
  Quantum computers may still be years away, but it's prudent that end-to-end encryption providers are ramping up defences

  A pressing question, then, is when that moment may arrive. At present, nobody really knows. It's a bit like nuclear fusion. Quantum evangelists claim that it's only a few years away. At the high end, some observers think it's 30-plus years away and there are sceptics who find the whole idea implausible. **But then it's not that long since people thought that large language models were pie in the sky. So it may be prudent not to be too complacent.**

  **That's certainly the view taken by Signal**, one of the providers of the encrypted messaging service that I and many of my colleagues use. **“We are not in a position to judge which timeline is most likely,”**
