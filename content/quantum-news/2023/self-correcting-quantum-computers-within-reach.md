Harvard team's method of reducing errors tackles major barrier to scaling up technology

[A new paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06481-y) illustrates a Harvard quantum computing platform's potential to solve the longstanding problem known as quantum error correction.

In the new paper, the team reports near-flawless performance of its two-qubit entangling gates with extremely low error rates. For the first time, they demonstrated the ability to entangle atoms with error rates below 0.5 percent.
