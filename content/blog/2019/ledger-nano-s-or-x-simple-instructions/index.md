There’s a full instructional video coming, and extensive full text-instructions with pictures already on our [documentation site](https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/), but for those that want the TL;DR of installing QRL on your ledger device, this is for you.

If you already have setup Ledger Live before and are all updated, you will want to skip straight to [step 3](#8897).

## Setup and installation

### 1. Install Ledger Live

The easiest way to install QRL on your ledger device is through [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live). If you already have Ledger Live, ensure you install the latest firmware update.

### 2. Setup your Ledger device

If you’ve already done so, you can skip to step 3, otherwise follow the instructions on the [Ledger documentation website: first-steps](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233-Take-your-first-steps)

### 3. Connect and unlock your Ledger device

### 4. Go to Manager and search for QRL

After you have connected your device, search for QRL in the manager and click install. Follow any prompts.

*Note: Ledger Live just enables easy installation of the QRL app on your ledger device, you will not be able to add or manage your QRL account from there.*

### 5. Initialising the QRL App

Open the QRL app on your ledger device and scroll down to where it says **Init Device** and press *both buttons*. This will generate 256 keys (note: be patient, this takes about half an hour). After you are done, your device will be say **QRL READY rem:256. [More details](https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/#initialising-the-qrl-app)**

## Using your device

### 1. Make sure your device is unlocked (you don’t need Ledger Live for this) and the QRL app is open to “QRL READY”

### 2. Open the webwallet in explorer and Goto open wallet

Direct link [here](https://wallet.theqrl.org/open).

### 3. Select from the dropdown “Ledger Nano S” or “Ledger Nano X” and click “Open Ledger Nano S” or “Open Ledger Nano X”

### 4. Done

Congratulations, you have successfully installed the QRL app and connected it to the wallet for secure transfers!

## Extra

As a reminder, this is just a brief overview, if you want more information you can always head over to our extensive documentation page on the [Ledger Nano](https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/) or ask any questions you may have on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/QRL), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QRLedger), [Discord](https://discord.gg/jBT6BEp), or email [support@theqrl.org](mailto:support@theqrl.org).

For those that are a bit more patient, we also have a video in the works covering this process.
