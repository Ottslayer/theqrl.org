summary: Several countries, including France, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands,
  and Canada, have imposed identical export restrictions on quantum computers
  with more than 34 qubits due to national security concerns, despite current
  low capabilities of the technology, likely influenced by their participation
  in the Wassenaar Agreement.

Several countries, including France, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands, and Canada, have imposed identical restrictions on the export of quantum computers with more than 34 qubits and above a certain error threshold, citing national security concerns. These nations are part of the Wassenaar Agreement, an export control regime that regulates dual-use technologies. Despite inquiries from New Scientist, the rationale behind these specific restrictions remains undisclosed, with the UK stating that revealing the reasoning would pose a national security risk. Experts in the field, such as Christopher Monroe of IonQ, are baffled by the criteria for these restrictions, suggesting a lack of transparency and clarity.
