blurb: |
  Researchers from the University of Texas, El Paso have developed a highly magnetic quantum computing material that retains its magnetism at room temperature. The material, which does not contain high-demand rare earth minerals, exhibits superparamagnetic behavior, making it a potential option for creating qubits, the basic unit of quantum information. By synthesizing the material in a sequential process, the researchers were able to produce a material 100 times more magnetic than pure iron. Further testing is needed, but this development offers promising potential for stable qubits and advancements in quantum computing.
