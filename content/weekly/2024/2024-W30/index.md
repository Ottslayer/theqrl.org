## This Wednesday, we’ll be hosting our latest AMA with Kaushal (QRL Lead Blockchain Developer)

As our QRL Zond development progresses, we want to continue to cover everything you’re curious about whether you have a specific question around what stage we’re at in development, testing/functionality, setup, or something else entirely around dev progress.

This upcoming AMA is a build on our last Dev AMA with Kaushal here: https://youtu.be/AzUqtH1a8m4
