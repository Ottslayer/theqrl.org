blurb: |
  With new software and hardware, Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which powers most AI, is positioning itself as a quantum computing leader. Nvidia unveiled CUDA Quantum, a platform for building quantum algorithms in C++ and python, at GTC on Tuesday. The programme would run the algorithm on quantum and classical computers to find the most efficient solution. Nvidia's DGX Quantum hardware system connects quantum and classical computers. It is unclear when quantum computers could perform some calculations millions of times faster than the fastest supercomputer. Researchers can create hybrid applications and crucial quantum computing methods with DGX Quantum.
