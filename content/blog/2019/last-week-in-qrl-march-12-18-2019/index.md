## Introduction

Here in North America, Daylight Savings Time has come and gone once more, signalling for many the near-arrival of spring. However, in much of the rest of the world, DST does not arrive for another few weeks. In the meantime, we are double-checking our schedules whenever we have to meet to ensure we do not miss one another. As always, there was much activity behind the scenes. Below is a bit of what we can talk about right now.

## Development

* **Go QRL:** Now receives unconfirmed transactions
* **Vote_Tx:** Planning for this transaction type discussed
* **Block Explorer:** Additional desirable features discussed (e.g. token type-ahead in search) — input welcomed from wider QRL community

## Website Update

In the coming weeks, you will notice some changes to the website. At QRL, we believe in regularly checking in with and updating our website. With new sections, some new content, and a new emphasis on QIPs, we hope that the website update will be an improvement. As always, we have and will continue to utilize user and community feedback. The best way to effect change is to make your opinion known to us, preferably through opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/issues), where they can be tracked and followed up on more easily.
