The team at QRL is delighted to announce the 'Build on QRL Protocol' hackathon event **has officially begun!**

We’re beginning the Hackathon with Team Building & Ideation (Stage 1).

The importance of this stage is threefold:

1. For you to understand Hackathon [Rules & Guidelines](/events/qrl-hackathon-2022/rules/)
2. [Register](/events/qrl-hackathon-2022/register/) (if you haven’t already)!
3. Join Discord for Team Building to inform us if you’ll be in-person/online, ability to form teams/ideate/ask us questions/and so on.
